Installing these fan smoke sets with a free outlet (arrangement C) causes additional loss of dynamic pressure in the fan outlet. By fitting a diffuser on the outlet, some of this dynamic pressure loss is recovered as static pressure. To compensate for the different outlet configurations, the below correction factors ([TECH]Cf[/TECH]) can be used.\n\n![Correction factors](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/4lzftt30/correction-factors.png)\n\n### Downloads\n\n#### Datasheets\n[TECH_DOC]- [Datasheet ZerAx Dual Smoke Fan Set](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/download-links/datasheet-zerax-dual-smoke-fan-set/)[/TECH_DOC]\n\n#### Catalogues\n[TECH_DOC]- [GB - Axial fans ZerAx](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1xnd1ktu/zerax-cat-gb-mu16216-0124.pdf)\n- [DK - Axial fans ZerAx](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/4usf1cy1/zerax-cat-dk-mu15417-0515.pdf)\n- [D - Axial fans ZerAx](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1346/zerax-cat-d-mu-15873-0515.pdf)\n- [NL - Axial fans ZerAx](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5810/zerax-cat-nl-mu16127-0721.pdf)[/TECH_DOC]\n\n#### Manuals\n[TECH_DOC]- [GB - Axial fans AZL-AZN-AZW](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/ulkpmly5/azl-azn-azw-gb-mu16219-0324.pdf)\n- [DK - Axial fans AZL-AZN-AZW](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/jodnuccj/azl-azn-azw-dk-mu16222-0324.pdf)\n- [D - Axial fans AZN-AZW](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/mpzbajn2/azl-azn-azw-de-mu16135-0324.pdf)\n- [S - Axial fans AZN-AZW](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1390/azn-azw-s-mu14714-0513.pdf)[/TECH_DOC]\n\n#### Declarations of Performance\n[TECH_DOC]- [GB - AZN 250-2000 (System 1)](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/wunasbyr/zerax-family-dop-gb-mu16227-0424.pdf)[/TECH_DOC]\n\n#### Certificates\n[TECH_DOC]- [AZN 250-2000 F200](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/eilhhptu/f200-azn-azl-azt-auz-250-2000-weg-0761-cpr-0928-gb-exp-25-01-2026.pdf)\n- [AZN 250-2000 F300](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/0efocipu/f300-azn-azl-azt-auz-250-2000-weg-0761-cpr-0927-gb-exp-24-01-2026.pdf)[/TECH_DOC]\n\n#### User guides\n[TECH_DOC]- [GB - Freq. conv.

OEMs face increasing demands for energy-efficient solutions while maintaining competitive pricing and reliable performance. Success requires reliable partners who deliver proven energy efficiency, superior system integration, and comprehensive technical support.\n\nOur environmentally friendly EC+ concept, developed through strategic partnership between Danfoss and NOVENCO, represents the market's most advanced response to energy efficiency demands. This comprehensive system solution for AHUs achieves unmatched overall efficiencies of 85% - outperforming competitive solutions by significant margins while reducing total cost of ownership.\n\nThe EC+ concept specifically targets HVAC system efficiency optimization through integrated component design. Our proven solution combines NOVENCO ZerAx\u00ae high-efficiency axial flow fans, premium IE4 and IE5 permanent magnet (PM) motors, and intelligent Danfoss VLT\u00ae frequency converters in optimized configurations.\n\n## Integration cuts construction costs 40%\n\nTechnical compatibility drives OEM success across market applications. Our EC+ system delivers motor and frequency converter efficiencies above 95% through optimized component matching. Combined with ZerAx fan efficiency of 92%, total system efficiency reaches 85% under real-world operating conditions.\n\nThis performance represents 20-25 percentage points improvement over alternative solutions, including direct-driven centrifugal plug fans with EC motors. No other AHU system solution matches this efficiency level while maintaining operational reliability.\n\n### Compact Design Benefits for OEM Integration\n\nHigh ZerAx efficiency enables AHU designs up to 30% shorter and 30% lighter while maintaining identical performance characteristics. This optimization reduces material costs, shipping expenses, and installation space requirements for end users.\n\nOur ZerAx fans provide complete plug-and-play integration with standardized mounting interfaces. This approach simplifies your assembly processes, reduces installation complexity, and accelerates production scheduling. Sound levels remain significantly lower than competitive solutions, addressing stringent end-user acoustic requirements effectively.\n\nExtended 20+ year operational lifetimes contribute to sustainability goals while guaranteeing minimal maintenance requirements throughout the product lifecycle, reducing total cost of ownership for end customers.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the EC+ Efficiency Equation](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5979/ecplus-equation.jpg?rmode=max&width=757&height=368)\n\n## Dynamic Pressure Technology Advantage\n\nEnergy-efficient ventilation systems require comprehensive pressure utilization. HVAC systems limited to static pressure cannot exceed 90% efficiency, as dynamic pressure energy dissipates wastefully.\n\nMaximum system efficiency demands fans that harness both static and dynamic pressures. This approach delivers higher efficiency, reduced energy consumption, lower operating costs, and decreased carbon emissions.\n\nTraditional plug and centrifugal fan calculations rely solely on static pressure. These fans cannot utilize dynamic pressure, which literally disappears. Our axial fans utilize both static and dynamic pressures, enabling total pressure calculations and efficiencies above 90%.\n\nWhile plug and centrifugal fans appear simpler and offer flexible configurations, they become expensive choices in both operating costs and environmental impact. High-efficiency axial fans consume substantially less energy, reducing costs and carbon emissions. Efficiency becomes the critical parameter for intelligent fan solution selection.\n\n![Illustration of airflow in a centrifugal fan](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5980/still_flow_centrifugalfan_web.jpg?rmode=max&width=564)\n\n![Illustration of a flow in centrifugal fan system](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5981/still_flow_4xplugfan_web.jpg?rmode=max&width=564)\n\n![Light blue pattern illustrating air flow in a centrifugal fan](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5982/still_flow_axialfan_web.jpg?rmode=max&width=564)\n\n_Airflow comparison: centrifugal fan, plug fans, and NOVENCO ZerAx axial fan_\n\n## ZerAx Advanced ZerAx Engineering\n\nMost centrifugal fans achieve efficiencies between 65-70%. Standard axial flow fans typically perform at 80%. This significant difference stems from airflow patterns through the fan.\n\nAxial flow fans maintain airflows parallel to the fan axis. Centrifugal fans create perpendicular airflows to the fan axis, losing most velocity energy through this design.\n\nMinimal losses in axial fans result from aerodynamic design creating straight airflows with negligible turbulence. This fundamental design difference provides consistently higher efficiency levels.\n\nOur NOVENCO ZerAx axial flow fans achieve unmatched efficiencies up to 92%. These performance levels establish new industry benchmarks, reducing overall power consumption and operational sound levels.

See all NOVENCO Building & Industry's EC+ concepts here. We develop and implement high efficient solutions.\ncanonical_url: https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/ecplus-concept\nog_title: EC+ concept\nog_url: https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/ecplus-concept/\nog_locale: en_US\nlanguage: en\nurl: https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/ecplus-concept\nscraped_date: 2025-09-18\n---\n\n[SEO_NEEDED: Energy efficiency, Energy-efficient ventilation]\n\n# [SEO]EC+[/SEO] concept\n\nToday's high cost of energy as well as the increasing level of environmental awareness and political measures, spiral the search for modern and more efficient solutions in the field of energy saving. The environmentally friendly [SEO]EC+[/SEO] concept developed in close cooperation between [TECH]Danfoss[/TECH] and [TECH]NOVENCO[/TECH] is the latest market response to growing demands for energy saving. This most efficient system solutions for [TECH]AHUs[/TECH] are miles ahead of the competition with unmatched overall system efficiencies of [TECH]85%[/TECH]. The [SEO]EC+[/SEO] concept, that is specifically conceived to increase the efficiencies of [TECH]HVAC[/TECH] systems, comprises the [TECH]NOVENCO ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] series of high efficiency [SEO]axial flow fans[/SEO], high efficiency [TECH]IE4[/TECH] and [TECH]IE5[/TECH] permanent magnet [TECH](PM)[/TECH] motors and the intelligent and high efficiency [TECH]Danfoss VLT\u00ae[/TECH] frequency drives.\n\n### [TECH]EC+[/TECH] system efficiency and compact [TECH]AHU[/TECH] system design\n\nWith motor and frequency drive efficiencies both reaching above [TECH]95%[/TECH], the [TECH]ZerAx[/TECH] fan efficiency of [TECH]92%[/TECH] brings the overall system efficiency to an impressing [TECH]85%[/TECH]. This is [TECH]20-25 percentage points[/TECH] better than the closest alternative solutions, such as direct-driven centrifugal plug fans with [TECH]EC[/TECH] motors. It is the highest possible overall system efficiency for [TECH]AHUs[/TECH] available on the market. Because of the high efficiencies of the [TECH]ZerAx[/TECH], it is possible to design [TECH]AHUs[/TECH] up to [TECH]30%[/TECH] shorter and [TECH]30%[/TECH] lighter and still have the same performance characteristics and hence cut expenditures. The [TECH]ZerAx[/TECH] fans for [TECH]AHUs[/TECH] are complete plug-and-play solutions to ensure easy and fast installation. The fan sound levels are significantly lower than those from other fan manufacturers. The fan lifetimes are [TECH]20+ years[/TECH], which contribute to sustainability and guarantee low maintenance costs.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the EC+ Efficiency Equation](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5979/ecplus-equation.jpg?rmode=max&width=757&height=368)\n\n### Dynamic pressure is the keyword\n\n[TECH]HVAC[/TECH] systems which only utilise the static pressure cannot achieve efficiencies above [TECH]90%[/TECH], as the dynamic pressure goes to waste. To maximise the energy efficiency of any ventilation system, fans must use both static and dynamic pressures. The result is higher efficiency, lower energy consumption, reduced operating costs and lower carbon emissions.\n\nThe efficiencies of plug and centrifugal fans, as used in many [TECH]HVAC[/TECH] systems, are calculated solely on the basis of the static pressure. This is because these fans are unable to utilise the dynamic pressure, which literally disappears into thin air. Axial fans on the other hand utilise both the static and the dynamic pressures, which allows for calculations based on the total pressure. Efficiencies above [TECH]90%[/TECH] are then achievable, as less energy goes to waste.\n\nAlthough plug and centrifugal fans appear simpler and are more flexible constructions than axial fans, they turn quickly out to be expensive choices \u2013 both in terms of operating costs and the environmental impact. High efficiency axial fans consume much less energy, reduce cost and carbon emissions, which makes efficiency a critical key parameter in the choice of fan solution.\n\n![Illustration of airflow in a centrifugal fan](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5980/still_flow_centrifugalfan_web.jpg?rmode=max&width=564)\n\n![Illustration of a flow in centrifugal fan system](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5981/still_flow_4xplugfan_web.jpg?rmode=max&width=564)\n\n![Light blue pattern illustrating air flow in a centrifugal fan](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5982/still_flow_axialfan_web.jpg?rmode=max&width=564)\n\n*Difference in airflow between a centrifugal fan, plug fans and the [TECH]NOVENCO ZerAx[/TECH] axial fan*\n\n### [TECH]ZerAx[/TECH] and ground-breaking fan efficiencies\n\nMany [SEO]centrifugal fans[/SEO] reach efficiencies between [TECH]65-70%[/TECH], while [SEO]axial flow fans[/SEO] usually perform at up to [TECH]80%[/TECH]. A main reason for the significant difference is in the way the air moves through the fan. In [SEO]axial flow fans[/SEO] the airflows are parallel to the fan axis, whereas in centrifugal fans they flow perpendicular to the fan axis and thereby lose most of the velocity energy.\n\nThe minimum loss in axial fans is due to the aerodynamic design that gives straight airflows with no or very little turbulence. This difference in design generally provides higher efficiency levels in axial fans.\n\nThe [TECH]NOVENCO ZerAx[/TECH] [SEO]axial flow fans[/SEO] have unmatched fan efficiencies of up to [TECH]92%[/TECH]. These efficiencies push fan designs to new levels, and thus lower the overall power consumption and sound. [TECH]ZerAx[/TECH] axial fans are the most [SEO]energy-efficient[/SEO] on the market today.\n\n[TECH_DOC]<!-- Downloads Section -->\n### Downloads\n\n**Brochures:**\n- [EC+ Concept](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1664/novenco-danfoss-ecplus-gb-mu-15951-1121.pdf)\n- [EC+ UPGRADES](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/xsmppi0x/ecplus-upgrade-mu-15952-0425.pdf)\n- [Best possible fan for AHUs](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/3jpbhaxf/novenco-best-possible-fan-for-ahu-gb-mu-16156-0425.pdf)\n\n**Cases:**\n- [DS Group](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/6129/ds-group-gb-mu-16166-0522.pdf)\n- [Keppel Bay Tower](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5742/keppel-bay-tower-gb-mu-16059-0121.pdf)\n- [Automotive industry](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5752/automotive-industry-mu-16062-0221-gb.pdf)\n- [VW Navarra](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/2110/vw-navarra-mu-15863-0319-gb.pdf)\n- [JK Tyres](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1981/jk-tyres-mu-15711-0918-gb.pdf)\n- [Innovative AHU concepts](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1152/trubel-tuev-mu-15676-0218-gb.pdf)[/TECH_DOC]\n\n## Related Products\n\n- [TECH_DOC][Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZL](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-zerax-azl/)[/TECH_DOC]\n- [TECH_DOC][Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZN-AZW](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-zerax-azn-azw/)[/TECH_DOC]\n- [TECH_DOC][Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZL-AZN Standard Ranges](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-zerax-azl-azn-standard-ranges/)[/TECH_DOC]\n\n## Related Solutions\n\n- [TECH_DOC][AHU fans](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/ahu-fans/)[/TECH_DOC]\n- [TECH_DOC][Data centres](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/data-centres/)[/TECH_DOC]\n- [TECH_DOC][Retrofits](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/retrofits/)[/TECH_DOC]"

For [SEO]ventilation[/SEO], they came up with a solution using small [SEO]jet fans[/SEO]. As a supplier of larger [SEO]jet fans[/SEO] for road tunnels, [TECH]Novenco[/TECH] was asked to develop and install these compact jet fans. From thereon, [TECH]Novenco[/TECH] has pioneered and set new industrial standards for the ventilation of closed car parks. These thrust [SEO]ventilation systems[/SEO] for [SEO]underground car park[/SEO]s and delivery bays are among our fundamental technologies and expertise. From the start our [SEO]car park ventilation[/SEO] solutions with the small and very compact jet fans revolutionized the market for parking facilities. These [SEO]car park[/SEO] jet fans have long since shown to be invaluable assets for optimal ventilation for the emission of toxic exhaust gases and smoke removal in case of a fire inside the car park.\n\nIn enclosed car parks, mechanical ventilation is necessary to keep the level of hazardous gases such as [TECH]carbon monoxide (CO)[/TECH] to a minimum. By using jet fans, these ventilation systems can be designed without the use of bulky ductwork. The small car park jet fans are strategically positioned and can ventilate large areas of the car park by means of induction. In combination with low-pressure axial flow fans to supply fresh air and extract the contaminated air, these jet-ventilation systems are suitable for efficient ventilation of any car park.\n\nA ventilation system with jet fans offers numerous advantages over conventional ducted ventilation systems:\n\n- Space saving; the function of complex ductwork in the car park, taking up valuable space which is already restricted, is replaced by small, compact jet fans.\n- Flexible installation; positioning of the jet fans is very flexible and can be easily coordinated with other systems within the car park.\n- Optimal ventilation; because the jet fans efficiently mix the exhaust fumes with the surrounding air, high local concentrations of toxic gases are prevented.\n- No dead spots; because jet fans can be placed in parts of the car park with limited ventilation, the build-up of high local concentrations are prevented.\n- Energy savings; compared with ventilation systems with ductwork, relevant energy savings can be achieved.\n- Cost savings; during design and installation the (re-)positioning of the jet fans is very flexible.\n- Combined solution for normal ventilation and smoke ventilation in case of a fire.\n- Smoke control systems can be designed as an engineered solution, to provide clear smoke-free access for fire-fighters to a point close to the seat of the fire.\n\n![Large metal exhaust fan designed for car parks](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5856/web-1920px-jpg-q70-auz-magnelis_2.jpg?rmode=max&width=360&height=258) ![Jet fan perfect for smoke ventilation](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/6067/web-1920px-q70-azt-magnelis_1.jpg?rmode=max&width=380&height=313)\n\nOur car park solutions are very efficient, using a minimum amount of energy in all ventilation scenarios. The solution is truly 2-in-1 as they help protect lives and assets, as well as the environment.\n\nFor more detailed information on this solution, use the read more link below.\n\n### [TECH_DOC][Read more...](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/car-park-system-description/)[/TECH_DOC]\n\n[TECH_DOC]<!-- Downloads Section -->\n### Downloads\n\n**Brochures:**\n- [Car Park Ventilation System -

With [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] product lifetimes of [TECH]20+ years[/TECH], efficiencies up to [TECH]92%[/TECH] and low sound levels, the [TECH]NOVENCO's[/TECH] solutions for data centres are probably the world's most profitable and quietest solutions.\n\n![Cooling and ventilation fans in a data centre](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/4305/facebook-1.jpg?rmode=max&width=564)\n\n### [TECH]NOVENCO'S ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] fans\n\n[TECH]NOVENCO[/TECH] Building & Industry has a wide range of [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] axial flow fans for use in different applications within a data centre.\n\nOur fans are world leading when it comes to durability, efficiency and sound levels. The [TECH]Total Cost of Ownerships (TCO)[/TECH] of [TECH]20+ years[/TECH], unmatched fan efficiencies up to [TECH]92%[/TECH] and low sound levels, makes [TECH]NOVENCO's[/TECH] fans probably the most profitable and the quietest in the world. The long lifetimes and the high performance of our fans secure long maintenance intervals and low service cost.\n\n![NOVENCO'S ZerAx\u00ae fans in a data center](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/4306/facebook-4.jpg?rmode=max&width=564)\n\n### Optimise the advantage of convenience climate condition\n\nThe quality of the air that cools data halls and centres is among the most important parameters to consider in the design of these massive structures. A well thought-over regional location to facilitate free cooling calls for equally well worked out specifications to achieve precise control of temperature, humidity and airflow, which is crucial for the operability and economy of the centres. Sensitive and huge amounts of servers that operate even just a fraction off the optimum can quickly suffer and advance planned replacement.\n\n### [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] is the answer\n\nThe ventilation and efficiency aspirations of even the best constructions and the most leak-proof designs cannot be better than the key components that drive the systems \u2013 the fans. Good, reliable and efficient fans make all the difference and together with the high requirements for controllable air quality, the field of suitable fans quickly narrows in. The [TECH]NOVENCO ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] axial flow fans with energy-efficient [TECH]EC+[/TECH] motors are such suitable fans and have since the introduction in [TECH]2009[/TECH] been far ahead of the competition. A lead that, with fan efficiencies up to [TECH]92%[/TECH], still holds.\n\nThe design and performance of the [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] is efficient in every detail and gives designers and constructors optimal freedom. The form factor of the fans makes them suitable as free-blowing or as duct fans. The low [TECH]total cost of ownership or TCO[/TECH] of employing [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] fans is world-leading with top-of-class fan efficiencies, low sound levels and lifetimes of [TECH]20+ years[/TECH].\n\n![NOVENCO ZerAx\u00ae ventilation system](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/4307/facebook-6.jpg?rmode=max&width=564)\n\n### [TECH]NOVENCO[/TECH] strong references\n\nThe [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] fans are already installed in the biggest data centres in the Europe and the USA where they keep servers cool, save energy and protect the environment.\n\n[TECH_DOC]<!-- Downloads Section -->\n### Downloads\n\n**Brochures:**\n- [NOVENCO Data Centers GB Mu 16280 0925](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/fezdiozd/novenco-data-centers-gb-mu-16280-0925.pdf)\n\n**Cases:**\n- [Data Center, Northern Scandinavia](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1176/data-center-mu-15499-0317-gb.pdf)[/TECH_DOC]\n\n## Related Products\n\n- [TECH_DOC][Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZL](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-zerax-azl/)[/TECH_DOC]\n- [TECH_DOC][Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZL-AZN Standard Ranges](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-zerax-azl-azn-standard-ranges/)[/TECH_DOC]\n- [TECH_DOC][Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZN-AZW](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-zerax-azn-azw/)[/TECH_DOC]\n- [TECH_DOC][Acoustic diffusers](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/fan-accessories/acoustic-diffusers/)[/TECH_DOC]\n- [TECH_DOC][Silencers](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/fan-accessories/silencers/)[/TECH_DOC]\n\n## Related Solutions\n\n- [TECH_DOC][Cooling](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/cooling/)[/TECH_DOC]\n- [TECH_DOC][EC+ concept](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/ecplus-concept/)[/TECH_DOC]\n- [TECH_DOC][Retrofits](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/retrofits/)[/TECH_DOC]"

This is due to the unmatched [TECH]EC+ total system efficiencies of up to 85%[/TECH]. The [TECH]EC+ concept[/TECH] is specifically conceived to increase the efficiencies of [TECH]HVAC systems[/TECH] and comprises the [TECH]NOVENCO ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] series of high-efficiency [SEO]axial fans[/SEO], high-efficiency [TECH]IE4 and IE5[/TECH] permanent magnet ([TECH]PM[/TECH]) motors and the intelligent and high-efficiency [TECH]Danfoss VLT\u00ae frequency drives[/TECH].\n\n### ENERGY SAVINGS WITH [TECH]ZERAX\u00ae[/TECH] AND [TECH]EC+[/TECH]\n\u2022 [TECH]AT LEAST 20% COMPARED TO BEST-IN-CLASS EC FANS[/TECH]\n\u2022 [TECH]TYPICALLY, 40% BY RETROFIT OF OLD PLUG FANS[/TECH]\n\u2022 [TECH]TYPICALLY, 50% BY RETROFIT OF OLD CENTRIFUGAL FANS[/TECH]\n\n![NOVENCO ZerAx\u00ae high-efficiency axial fan](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5776/06_ahu-86.png?rmode=max&width=564)\n\n![Illustration of AHU with plug fan and ZerAx axial fan](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/4162/ahu.jpg?rmode=max&width=564)\n\n### [TECH]EC+[/TECH] system efficiency and compact [TECH]AHU[/TECH] system design\n\nIn optimum configurations the motor and frequency drive efficiencies can reach above [TECH]95%[/TECH], which together with the [TECH]ZerAx fan efficiency of 92%[/TECH] brings the overall system efficiency to an impressing [TECH]85%[/TECH]. This is [TECH]20-25 percentage points[/TECH] better than alternative solutions, such as direct-driven centrifugal plug fans with [TECH]EC motors[/TECH]. It is currently the highest possible total system efficiency for [TECH]AHUs[/TECH] on the market. Because of the high efficiencies of the [TECH]ZerAx[/TECH], it is possible to design [TECH]AHUs up to 30% shorter and 30% lighter[/TECH] and still have the same performance characteristics and hence cut expenditures. The [TECH]ZerAx fans for AHUs[/TECH] are complete plug-and-play solutions to ensure easy and fast installation. The fan noise levels are notably and significantly lower than those from other fan manufacturers. The fan lifetimes are [TECH]20+ years[/TECH], which contribute to sustainability and guarantee low maintenance costs.\n\n![The EC+ efficiency equation](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5979/ecplus-equation.jpg?rmode=max&width=683&height=332)\n\n### Fast and easy [TECH]EC+[/TECH] upgrades\n\n[TECH]Non-EC+ fans[/TECH] installed in [TECH]HVAC systems[/TECH] represent up to [TECH]60%[/TECH] of the total [SEO]energy consumption[/SEO]. [TECH]NOVENCO's[/TECH] complete plug-and-play solutions guarantee easy and fast retrofit of existing installations without unnecessary replacement of whole [TECH]AHUs[/TECH] or [TECH]HVAC systems[/TECH]. Upgrading to [TECH]EC+ solutions[/TECH] with [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] fans radically reduces energy consumption and maintenance costs, hence increases the efficiency of the whole [TECH]HVAC system[/TECH]. Retrofit works are often completed in less than [TECH]10 hours[/TECH]. The steps from upgradeable candidate to an optimised and [SEO]energy-efficient[/SEO] [TECH]EC+ AHU system[/TECH] are outlined below.\n\n**STEP 1 \u2013 Site study**\nIn the site study, the existing [TECH]HVAC system[/TECH] installations are analysed and described to best understand the requirements. The study is free of charge and gives an indication of the number of achievable benefits, including potential savings and [TECH]ROIs[/TECH].\n\n**STEP 2 \u2013 Estimation**\nThe findings from the site study go into a detailed estimation, which summarises the potential savings in energy consumption, the carbon footprint and the [TECH]Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)[/TECH] that are achievable by, for example, retrofitting plug fans installed in existing [TECH]AHUs[/TECH] with highly efficient [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] axial fans. The estimates include an indication of the cost of the [TECH]EC+[/TECH] solution.\n\n**STEP 3 \u2013 Proof of concept**\nAn external and independent consulting company conducts the [TECH]Proof of Concept (PoC)[/TECH]. The feasibility is verified in an initial trial installation to confirm the estimates. It includes the following.\n- measurement and removal of the existing fans in the [TECH]HVAC system[/TECH]\n- installation of [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] axial flow fans\n- operation and measurement of the new fans\nIf the [TECH]PoC[/TECH] cannot match the estimates, the trial is free of charge.\n\n**STEP 4 \u2013 Site upgrade**\nAfter completion of the [TECH]PoC[/TECH] and with convincing results, a detailed plan for savings and cost of the entire retrofit-project is drawn up. The upgrade is usually completed in a single or few stages.\n\n### Examples of the [TECH]EC+[/TECH] upgrades\n\n![Image showing a man operating a machine, illustrating the before and after results of a retrofit process](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/4159/before-after-1.jpg?rmode=max&width=498&height=345)\n\n![Image showing a large industrial fan and a small fan, illustrating the before and after of a retrofit upgrade](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/4160/before-after-2.jpg?rmode=max&width=487&height=298)\n\n![Two images of a metal machine with a fan, illustrating the before and after of a retrofit for improved performance](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/4161/before-after-3.jpg?rmode=max&width=477&height=299)\n\n[TECH_DOC]<!-- Downloads Section -->\n### Downloads\n\n**Brochures:**\n- [EC+ UPGRADES](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/xsmppi0x/ecplus-upgrade-mu-15952-0425.pdf)\n- [Best possible fan for AHUs](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/3jpbhaxf/novenco-best-possible-fan-for-ahu-gb-mu-16156-0425.pdf)\n\n**Cases:**\n- [Foundry Hall Ventilation](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/6134/foundry-hall-ventilation-gb-mu-16168-0522.pdf)\n- [DS Group](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/6129/ds-group-gb-mu-16166-0522.pdf)\n- [Keppel Bay Tower](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5742/keppel-bay-tower-gb-mu-16059-0121.pdf)\n- [Automotive industry](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5752/automotive-industry-mu-16062-0221-gb.pdf)\n- [VW Navarra](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/2110/vw-navarra-mu-15863-0319-gb.pdf)\n- [JK Tyres](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1981/jk-tyres-mu-15711-0918-gb.pdf)\n- [Innovative AHU concepts](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1152/trubel-tuev-mu-15676-0218-gb.pdf)\n- [Sima Power Station](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1159/sima-power-station-mu-15480-0517-gb.pdf)\n- [T\u00dcV S\u00fcd test laboratory](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1167/tuv-sud-mu-15491-0317-gb.pdf)\n- [Danish TV Station](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1169/tv-station-mu-15675-0519-gb.pdf)\n- [CS Gruppen](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1170/cs-gruppen-mu15501-0317-gb.pdf)\n- [Carlsberg](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1174/carlsberg-mu-15674-0218-gb.pdf)\n- [Odense University Hospital](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1178/odense-universitethospital-mu-15493-0317-gb.pdf)\n- [Aarhus Concert Hall](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1179/aarhus-musikhus-mu-15489-0317-gb.pdf)[/TECH_DOC]\n\n## Related Products\n\n[TECH_DOC]- [Axial Flow Fans NovAx ACN-ACW](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-novax-acn-acw/)\n- [Axial Flow Fans NovAx ACN Standard Range](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-novax-acn-standard-range/)\n- [Axial Flow Fans NovAx ACP-ACG](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-novax-acp-acg/)\n- [Axial Flow Fans NovAx ARN](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-novax-arn/)\n- [Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZL](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-zerax-azl/)\n- [Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZN-AZW](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-zerax-azn-azw/)\n- [Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZL-AZN Standard Ranges](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-zerax-azl-azn-standard-ranges/)\n- [Acoustic diffusers](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/fan-accessories/acoustic-diffusers/)\n- [Silencers](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/fan-accessories/silencers/)[/TECH_DOC]\n\n## Related Solutions\n\n[TECH_DOC]- [EC+ concept](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/ecplus-concept/)\n- [AHU fans](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/ahu-fans/)\n- [Cooling](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/cooling/)[/TECH_DOC]"

The toxic gas mixture contains suspended particulates and lethal chemical compounds that create immediate life-threatening conditions.\n\n![Grenfell tower fire 2017](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/4322/pds_grenfell_fire.jpg?width=500&height=282.5)\n\nWhile sprinkler systems provide compartmentalization control, they cannot eliminate smoke exposure risks. Additional smoke control systems with dedicated pressurization capabilities are essential for maintaining tenable conditions during evacuation.\n\nOur escape route ventilation solutions include comprehensive staircase pressurization and smoke pressurization system designs that meet current engineering standards.\n\n## Engineering specifications for smoke control systems\n\nSmoke control systems integrate with overall fire engineering strategies for multi-story buildings. Design coordination involves all project stakeholders to ensure compatibility with fire protection schemes and regulatory compliance.\n\nKey system requirements include:\n\n- **Performance standards** that complement fire engineering strategies\n- **Measurable safety levels** verified through testing protocols\n- **Regulatory compliance** with national and international standards\n- **Stakeholder coordination** across all design disciplines\n\nThe primary design objective maintains smoke-free conditions in designated escape routes. This can be achieved through smoke extract systems or pressure differential systems.\n\n## Technical principles of pressure differential systems\n\nAir movement follows pressure gradients from higher to lower pressure zones. Engineering design establishes controlled pressure increases in protected areas relative to fire-origin areas to prevent smoke infiltration.\n\nThe design specification establishes measured pressure gradients from protected spaces to unprotected spaces when doors remain closed. With doors open, calculated air velocities across openings prevent smoke migration into protected zones. Our pressure differential systems with pressurization fans achieve these performance parameters.\n\nNOVENCO introduces the ClearChoice\u2122 Pressure Differential Systems (PDS) as an engineered solution for creating smoke-free zones. Our systems facilitate occupant evacuation from buildings and tunnels while supporting firefighting operations by preventing smoke migration.\n\nApplication specifications cover various building types and tunnel configurations where escape route protection is required:\n\n- **Stairwells and corridors** for primary evacuation routes\n- **Escape tunnels and lobbies** for secondary protection zones\n- **Firefighting access routes** for emergency response teams\n- **Building envelope penetrations** requiring smoke containment\n\nThree primary design objectives address regulatory requirements:\n\n- **Escape route protection** maintaining tenable conditions\n- **Firefighting access route protection** for emergency operations\n- **Property protection standards** preventing smoke damage\n\n### Escape route protection specifications\n\nThis represents the critical design objective where tenable environmental conditions must be maintained in protected spaces throughout anticipated occupancy evacuation periods.\n\n### Firefighting access route specifications\n\nBuilding classification determines requirements for protecting firefighting access routes and maintaining smoke-free conditions. Our pressure differential systems prevent or limit smoke spread into designated firefighting routes under operational conditions.\n\n### Property protection standards\n\nThe third design objective prevents smoke migration into sensitive spaces containing equipment or materials requiring protection from smoke damage.\n\nEuropean requirements for smoke control systems are specified in EN 12101 \"Smoke and heat control systems\". Pressure differential system specifications are detailed in EN 12101 part 6. Current part 6 with PDS kits undergoes revision with part 13 addition: \"Pressure differential systems (PDS) - Design and calculation methods, installation, acceptance testing, routine testing and maintenance\".\n\n## Pressure differential system design fundamentals\n\nOur pressure differential systems maintain tenable conditions in protected spaces including escape routes, firefighting access routes, firefighting lift shafts, lobbies, staircases and designated smoke-free areas.\n\nOur systems create measured differential pressure between protected and unprotected spaces on fire floors to prevent smoke migration from unprotected to protected spaces.\n\nWith simultaneous door openings, our systems generate minimum air velocities across open door areas to prevent smoke entry into protected spaces. Air supply fans deliver calculated airflow rates to achieve required velocity specifications.\n\nAirflow path analysis throughout buildings encompasses fresh air supply introduction points, air and smoke exhaust locations, and circulation pathways throughout the building envelope.\n\nEssential system components include:\n\n- **Air supply and extract systems** for controlled ventilation\n- **Differential pressure control** between protected and unprotected spaces\n- **Air release pathways** for pressure relief and increased airflow\n\n<!-- Video embed placeholder -->\n<!-- Video: https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qw_L9eKbRnQ -->\n\n<!-- Video embed placeholder -->\n<!-- Video: https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O5218B92r-Q -->\n\n## EN 12101-6 EN 12101-6 system classification specifications\n\nCurrent EN 12101 part 6 defines 6 classifications for pressure differential systems based on building use specifications.

A key requirement in the life safety regulations is to ensure the safe [SEO]escape routes[/SEO] and evacuation of people. Most fire related deaths are caused by the inhalation of smoke and toxic gases produced by the fire and not directly by the fire itself. Therefore, the most significant threat is the highly toxic smoke, which is a lethal cocktail made up of a complex mix of suspended particles and highly toxic gases.\n\n![Grenfell tower fire 2017](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/4322/pds_grenfell_fire.jpg?width=500&height=282.5)\n\nAlthough nowadays the buildings are more frequently equipped with sprinkler systems, this alone will not ensure the occupants are not exposed to toxic smoke in case of a fire. It is evident that sprinkler systems can contribute in life safety by controlling the fire within a compartment, but in many cases the sprinkler will not extinguish the fire. Therefore, an additional [SEO]smoke control[/SEO] system with [SEO]pressurization[/SEO] fan function is necessary to ensure that people can find a safe way out.\n\n## Smoke control systems\n\nSmoke control systems form an element of the overall fire engineering strategy for apartment buildings and should be designed together with all the involved parties. It is the responsibility of the designer of the smoke control systems to ensure that any proposed systems compliment the fire engineering strategy and provide a suitable level of fire safety.\n\nThe main objective of these smoke control systems is to ensure safe evacuation of a building by keeping escape routes free from smoke. This can either be achieved by [SEO]smoke extract systems[/SEO] or by [SEO]pressure differential systems[/SEO].\n\n## Pressure differential systems\n\nAir will naturally try to move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. By increasing the pressure in the protected areas (i.e. the escape routes) above that in the areas where the fire is likely to occur (in this case the apartments) it is possible to prevent smoke spread into these escape routes.\n\nThe aim therefore is to establish a pressure gradient from the protected space to the unprotected space (fire room) while the doors are closed. In case of doors open, a suitable air velocity should be established over the door openings to prevent the spread of smoke into the protected space. This pressure gradient can be achieved through pressure differential systems with [SEO]pressurization fans[/SEO].\n\nFor this purpose [TECH]NOVENCO[/TECH] introduces the [TECH]ClearChoice\u2122 Pressure Differential Systems (PDS)[/TECH] as a solution for creating smoke free zones, that allow people to escape from buildings and tunnels and aid the firefighting services by preventing smoke spread through seams and cracks of physical barriers such as doors or other similar restricted openings.\n\nThe field of application differs for a variety of buildings and tunnels, where there is a need to protect means of escape such as stairwells, corridors, escape tunnels, lobbies, as well as for providing smoke free approach for the firefighting services.\n\nTo summarize, three major design objectives can be addressed:\n\n1. Protection of means of escape\n2. Protection of firefighting access routes\n3. Property protection\n\n### Protection of means of escape\n\nThis is the most important design objective of the pressurisation systems, where it is essential that tenable conditions for life safety are maintained in protected spaces for as long as they are likely to be in use by the building occupants.\n\n### Protection of firefighting routes\n\nDepending on the building classification, another design objective of the pressurisation systems is to protect firefighting access routes and keep them essentially free of smoke. In this case, the pressure differential system must be designed to prevent or at least limit the spread of smoke into the dedicated firefighting route under normal firefighting conditions.\n\n### Property protection\n\nThe third objective of the pressurisation system can be to prevent the spread of smoke from entering sensitive spaces such as those containing items that are particularly sensitive to smoke damage.\n\nIn Europe, the requirements for smoke control systems are described in the European Standard [TECH]EN 12101[/TECH] \"Smoke and heat control systems\". Specifications for pressure differential systems are described in [TECH]EN 12101 part 6[/TECH]. Currently this [TECH]part 6 with PDS kits[/TECH] is under revision and a [TECH]part 13[/TECH] will be added: \"Pressure differential systems (PDS) - Design and calculation methods, installation, acceptance testing, routine testing and maintenance\".\n\n## The basics of pressure differential systems\n\nPressure differential systems are designed to maintain tenable conditions in protected spaces such as, escape routes, firefighting access routes, firefighting lift shafts, lobbies, staircases and other areas that require to be kept free of smoke.\n\nThese pressure differential systems create a differential pressure between the protected space and the unprotected space of the fire floor to prevent the smoke spreading from the unprotected space to the protected space.\n\nIn case of (simultaneous) open doors, the pressure differential system must be designed to create a minimum air velocity over the area of the open doors to prevent smoke from entering the protected space. To achieve this air velocity, the air supply fan to the protected space must supply sufficient airflow over the sum of the open-door areas.\n\nAn important factor for these pressure differential systems are the airflow paths throughout the building, not only where the fresh air supply is introduced, but also where that air (and smoke) will leave the building and what paths it will follow in the process.\n\nFor a typical pressure differential system three basic components are necessary:\n\n1. air supply and air/smoke extract.\n2. differential pressure control between the protected and unprotected space.\n3. air release path for pressure relief and higher airflow with door(s) open.\n\n<!-- Video embed placeholder -->\n<!-- Video: https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qw_L9eKbRnQ -->\n\n<!-- Video embed placeholder -->\n<!-- Video: https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O5218B92r-Q -->\n\n## Pressure differential system classifications\n\nWithin the current [TECH]EN 12101 part 6[/TECH] there are [TECH]6 classifications[/TECH] for pressure differential systems based on the use of the building. For very small buildings, [TECH]class A[/TECH] from the [TECH]EN 12101-6[/TECH] can be used and for more complex buildings (hotels, hospitals, nursing homes) a selection can be made from the other system classifications.\n\n### System classification [TECH]EN 12101-6[/TECH]\n\n| System class | Examples of use |\n| ------------ | --------------- |\n| [TECH]A[/TECH] | No evacuation unless directly threatened by fire. Unlikely that more than one door to the protected area will be open at the same time. |\n| [TECH]B[/TECH] | **Firefighting support.** The fire brigade may be exposed to a developed fire which needs to be approached with a low smoke level. |\n| [TECH]C[/TECH] | Immediate, simultaneous, short-term evacuation in the event of fire. Persons are expected to be alert, aware and familiar with their surroundings. |\n| [TECH]D[/TECH] | Immediate, simultaneous, long-term evacuation in the event of fire. Persons are less alert (sleep) or not familiar with their surroundings (hotel). |\n| [TECH]E[/TECH] | Phased, long-term evacuation in case of fire. First fire floor, then other floors. Possibility of high fire load. |\n| [TECH]F[/TECH] | **Firefighting support.** The fire brigade may be exposed to a developed fire which needs to be approached with low smoke levels. |\n\n## [TECH]NOVENCO ClearChoice Active Pressure Differential Systems[/TECH]\n\nThe [TECH]ClearChoice systems[/TECH] are advanced smoke control systems from [TECH]NOVENCO[/TECH].

The [SEO]ventilation systems[/SEO] in facilities for growth such as these must ensure optimal conditions in the crops and promote healthy and disease-free growth. Factors like precise control of temperature, humidity, [TECH]CO\u2082-content[/TECH] and air circulation in combination with requirements for low [SEO]energy consumption[/SEO] and low maintenance costs put high demands on the quality and performance of the ventilation systems.\n\n[TECH]NOVENCO's[/TECH] experience within this field of products is long and stretches more than [TECH]70 years[/TECH] back with design, production and delivery of custom solutions. Our fans are proven and have certified performance, that offer strength, durability and reliability in even the harshest of conditions found in these unique environments.\n\n### Ventilation of mushroom farms\n\nThe cultivation of mushrooms is a delicate process that requires perfect balances and timing from beginning to end of the many phases involved in order to have a successful outcome. The common mushroom ([TECH]Latin: agaricus bisporus[/TECH]) needs optimal conditions and controlled growth for growers to meet market demands on time and at the lowest possible cost. The challenges this presents depends on the layout of the facility as well as the growers' individual requirements. Apart from several process fans, the ventilation system designs may include functionality like [SEO]heat recovery[/SEO], ammonia scrubbers, bio filters and odour treatment.\n\n![spacious greenhouse mushroom farm featuring numerous rows of mushrooms](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/4311/f7fc45-praca-sezonowa-w-belgii-zbieracze-pieczarek-poznan-zdjecia.jpg?rmode=max&width=590&height=270)\n\n### Ventilation of greenhouses\n\nCrops in greenhouses grow in equally unique environments as mushrooms in farms. The circulation of air creates even conditions for growth while at the same time also limits the risk of diseases and moisture damages. As a result, ventilation systems for greenhouses are critical as they keep cost down, increase production and ensure optimal conditions for the crops.\n\n![Sunlight streams through the roof of a greenhouse, illuminating the vibrant plants inside.](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1131/fotolia_70600080_l.jpg?rmode=max&width=585&height=390)\n\n### Choose the correct fans\n\nThe [SEO]fans[/SEO] are the single most important component for active ventilation of greenhouses and for the movement of air within these buildings. Circulation fans are often part of passive ventilation systems in structures with minimum ventilation.\n\nThe use of fans for air exchange is a very effective approach to pull air through the full length of structures and thereby avoid hot air pockets. [SEO]Extraction fans[/SEO] in higher locations in greenhouses are more effective for [SEO]cooling[/SEO] than fans in lower locations.\n\nActive ventilation systems have limited capacity to quickly change large volumes of air. If the design specifications for a greenhouse are inadequate, it can result in poor air circulation through the crops. Under-ventilated structures often have overheating problems in the crop that is in the middle of, for example, greenhouses.\n\nTo ensure correct capacity and installation, select the fans in consultation with an independent expert and [TECH]NOVENCO\u00ae[/TECH]. Ventilation fans generally must have enough capacity to completely replace the air in the greenhouse once every minute.\n\nTwo very important aspects in the choice of fans are the operational cost and noise generation. To be able to keep operational cost down can contribute considerably in the quest for satisfying economic outcomes. The control of noise may pose problems in the production facilities as well as in the areas surrounding the facilities. A good example of a fan, that more than meets these tough criteria, is the [TECH]NOVENCO ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH], which is the most [SEO]energy-efficient[/SEO] in the market and with very low noise levels.\n\nThe special set of challenges found in the aggressive environments known from mushrooms farms call for especially robust fans. Well-proven fans for these purposes are our [SEO]centrifugal fans[/SEO], that are optimised for delivery of process air in composting plants and withstand corrosion caused by the moist environments.\n\n## Related Products\n\n[TECH_DOC]- [Centrifugal Fans CAL](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/centrifugal-fans/centrifugal-fans-cal/)\n- [Centrifugal Fans CNA-CNB](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/centrifugal-fans/centrifugal-fans-cna-cnb/)\n- [Centrifugal Fans CND-CNF](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/centrifugal-fans/centrifugal-fans-cnd-cnf/)\n- [Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZN-AZW](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-zerax-azn-azw/)\n- [Axial Flow Fans NovAx ACN-ACW](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-novax-acn-acw/)\n- [Axial Flow Fans NovAx ACP-ACG](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-novax-acp-acg/)[/TECH_DOC]\n\n## Related Solutions\n\n[TECH_DOC]- [Agriculture](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/agriculture/)\n- [Cooling](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/cooling/)\n- [Drying](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/drying/)\n- [Process industry](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/process-industry/)[/TECH_DOC]"

[TECH]Ammonia, methane and hydrogen sulphide[/TECH] gases come from manure and can easily reach unacceptable levels. Furthermore, too high concentrations of gases reduce livestock productivity and create poor working conditions for the employees. Extreme levels cause severe injuries and death.\n\n### Ventilation system design for agricultural buildings\n\nSeveral criteria must be met by the ventilation system design. It is crucial to determine and adhere to the regulations and standards. The requirements for the ventilation system design depend on the type of livestock, age and body weight, which is why it is important to define what the intended use of the facility is and to consider future uses. Local weather conditions with consideration to global warming trends in the area are also of great importance. The ventilation system must be designed with an adequate supplemental heating and cooling for extreme climatic conditions.\n\n### Fans for HVAC ventilation systems in agricultural buildings\n\nThe purpose of agricultural buildings is to provide optimal conditions for the livestock's well-being and productivity. Effective ventilation is a key requirement in this connection, where [SEO]axial flow fans[/SEO] are very commonly employed. [SEO]Axial flow fans[/SEO] are excellent for achievement of both static and dynamic pressures for optimal energy utilisation. The fans are as such the most efficient for use in ventilation of these kinds of buildings. [TECH]NOVENCO[/TECH] Building & Industry produces [SEO]axial flow fans[/SEO], which are on the technological forefront when it comes to energy and cost-efficiency.\n\n### For optimal ventilation\n\n- **Fans should have the correct size** - Fans larger than necessary waste energy. However, large diameter fans are usually more efficient than smaller diameter fans.\n- **[SEO]Energy-efficient fans[/SEO] should be the preferred choice** - There is a significant difference between the best and worst performing fans. Moreover, fans with diffusers or cones are more efficient than fans without.\n\n## Related Products\n\n- [TECH_DOC][Centrifugal Fans CAL](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/centrifugal-fans/centrifugal-fans-cal/)[/TECH_DOC]\n- [TECH_DOC][Centrifugal Fans CNA-CNB](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/centrifugal-fans/centrifugal-fans-cna-cnb/)[/TECH_DOC]\n- [TECH_DOC][Centrifugal Fans CND-CNF](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/centrifugal-fans/centrifugal-fans-cnd-cnf/)[/TECH_DOC]\n- [TECH_DOC][Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZN-AZW](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-zerax-azn-azw/)[/TECH_DOC]\n- [TECH_DOC][Axial Flow Fans NovAx ACN-ACW](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-novax-acn-acw/)[/TECH_DOC]\n- [TECH_DOC][Axial Flow Fans NovAx ACP-ACG](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-novax-acp-acg/)[/TECH_DOC]\n\n## Related Solutions\n\n- [TECH_DOC][Mushrooms and greenhouses](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/mushrooms-and-greenhouses/)[/TECH_DOC]\n- [TECH_DOC][Cooling](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/cooling/)[/TECH_DOC]\n- [TECH_DOC][Drying](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/drying/)[/TECH_DOC]\n- [TECH_DOC][Process industry](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/process-industry/)[/TECH_DOC]"

Their freezer plants are located all over the country and from their most southern location in Padborg they ship [TECH]250-300 tons[/TECH] of food a day. That amounts to a total of [TECH]200,000 pallets per year[/TECH]. Part of the business is freezing fresh meat at [TECH]minus 30 \u00b0C[/TECH] and storing it at [TECH]minus 18 \u00b0C[/TECH] until it is shipped out into the world in freezer trucks and containers.\n\nThe company freezes up to [TECH]1,800 tons[/TECH] a day so naturally a large amount of energy is required to keep the plant going and to meet the customers' demands.\n\n[TECH]CS Gruppen A/S[/TECH] is even expanding their capacity in Padborg to expedite even greater quantities and accommodate the technological and environmental requirements of a modern freezer facility. When reviewing the plant for energy optimisation the existing fans were included in the review. The [TECH]25-30 year old[/TECH] fans represented a large part of the energy consumption in the freezing tower.\n\n### THE SOLUTION\n\nThe freezing of fresh meat occurs under extreme cold conditions with high requirements for quality and reliability of equipment. After a thorough dialogue with three different suppliers, each offering very different solutions, the decision was made to install the [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] [SEO]axial flow fans[/SEO] at the plant. This solution had the highest acquisition value, but calculations showed that the ROI would only be [TECH]23 months[/TECH]. This is due to the [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] fan efficiency of up to [TECH]90%[/TECH]. The ROI calculations are based on the plant running at full capacity ([TECH]5,000 hours per year[/TECH]). A reduction of the operation time will prolong the ROI.\n\n### EQUIPMENT DELIVERY\n\nThe freezing tunnel is in four sections each with an air volume of [TECH]100,000 m\u00b3/h[/TECH]. The design is for fast freezing of meat, which is placed on gratings in layers where air circulates in the spaces between to facilitate quick freezing. The tunnel has four [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae fans type AZL-900[/TECH] each with an airflow capacity of [TECH]25,000 m\u00b3/h[/TECH].\n\nThe [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae AZL-900[/TECH] has an efficiency of [TECH]90%[/TECH] and is delivered with highly efficient [TECH]IE3 motors[/TECH] designed for temperatures down to [TECH]-30 \u00b0C[/TECH], short diffuser on the outlet and silicone thermo cable for frost protection of the fan casing.\n\n### [TECH_DOC][View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1170/cs-gruppen-mu15501-0317-gb.pdf)[/TECH_DOC]"

Especially the automotive industry faces challenges to reduce major environmental contributions from the production lines and improve sustainability. An important and often critical area is in the need for efficient HVAC solutions, where future requirements grow rapidly and makes the green technology race spiral with implementation of continuously greener solutions.\n\n### SPORTY DYNAMICS MEETS CUTTING-EDGE FAN AND AHU TECHNOLOGIES\n\nAmong the manufacturers that already now addresses the climate goals at the end of the decade is a world famous German manufacturer of sports cars. Apart from the production of cars with sporty dynamics and of which many have become iconic, this manufacturer has upgraded the air-conditioning systems in the paint-spray lines with the latest and very efficient [SEO]AHU[/SEO] technology.\nThe top-modern and environmentally friendly paint-spray lines now benefit from the most economical and durable technology for [SEO]AHU[/SEO]s on the market, which incorporates the extremely efficient [TECH]NOVENCO\u00ae ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] [SEO]fan[/SEO]s. Just as the aerodynamics of the sport cars ensure smooth and uncomplicated airflows, so do the [TECH]ZerAx[/TECH] [SEO]axial fan[/SEO]s in the [SEO]AHU[/SEO]s. The single airflow [SEO]axial fan[/SEO]s are completely unlike [SEO]centrifugal fan[/SEO]s, where the dynamic pressure is lost due to the design. The [TECH]ZerAx[/TECH] does not throw anything away, as it keeps both the static and dynamic pressures, which result in huge and obvious energy advantages.\n\nSustainability is one the German sports cars manufacturer's prime goals and with use of [TECH]ZerAx[/TECH] [SEO]fan[/SEO]s they surpass the eco-design requirements set forth in the [TECH]EU directive 2009/125/EC[/TECH].\nIn addition, the [SEO]AHU[/SEO]s with [TECH]ZerAx[/TECH] [SEO]fan[/SEO]s, in comparison to [SEO]AHU[/SEO]s with [SEO]centrifugal fan[/SEO]s, reduce investments, save materials, require less space and generally boost comfort levels with low noise and sound.\n\n### THE [TECH]ZERAX\u00ae[/TECH] FAN \u2013 A GAME CHANGER WITH [TECH]92% FAN EFFICIENCY[/TECH]\n\nThe highly efficient [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] [SEO]axial flow fan[/SEO]s are in fact best in class and are well above the environmental legislative requirements of today in terms of [SEO]energy consumption[/SEO], sustainability and reusability. As such they are well-suited for much stricter future requirements.\nIn this installation, the market-leading fan efficiency of [TECH]92%[/TECH] ensures that almost all the aerodynamic energy is preserved and results in the equally impressive system efficiency of [TECH]81%[/TECH].\nQuite ingeniously the [TECH]NOVENCO[/TECH] engineers contribute to short AHU lengths with dual functionality as part of the fan design. The diffusers simply double as silencers and convert the airflow velocity into static pressure, while also reducing the sound levels.\n\n### [TECH_DOC][View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5752/porsche-mu-16062-0221-gb.pdf)[/TECH_DOC]"

The island is constantly developing in order to create a vibrant and dynamic new business environment, focusing on opportunities to stimulate the island's economy by giving businesses space to grow.\n\nThe International Finance Centre (IFC Jersey), a complex of [TECH]6 buildings[/TECH] in all, is designed by an award-winning team of architects and landscape designers to ensure a world-class business hub, providing environmentally sustainable Grade \"A\" office spaces. The first phase of IFC Jersey, Building 1 will create [TECH]67,000 sq ft[/TECH] of brand new, highest quality office spaces for new and expanding businesses. As part of this investment in Jersey's future, it has been decided that more than half of the total development area will be handed back to the community as new green environments and landscaped areas for residents to enjoy.\n\n## SAFE UNDERGROUND PARKING\n\nNovenco Building & Industry designed and installed a [SEO]car park ventilation[/SEO] system with [SEO]Jet Fans[/SEO] for the underground parking of Building 1. A custom made frame mount was designed and built to hold the [SEO][extract fans](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/smoke-fans/)[/SEO]. The frame was built from galvanized steel and installed on the roof. The whole construction was preassembled before it was shipped to the site.\n\nSpecial hooks were located on the top of the frame, to allow for attachment of lifting equipment when placing the construction at the designated location. The construction was placed on the roof due to lack of space within the underground car park.\n\n## EQUIPMENT DELIVERY\n\nFor the [SEO]car park ventilation[/SEO] system Novenco Building & Industry had to achieve [TECH]10 ACH (air changes per hour)[/TECH] due to insufficient openings. Therefore, a fully mechanical smoke clearance system, using [TECH]3 pcs CGF 500 Jet Fans[/TECH], were installed to help move the CO2 within the car park. The [SEO]Jet Fans[/SEO] push the contaminated air or smoke towards the extraction point. Here a ductwork directs it to the roof, where a purpose built frame mount is installed with [TECH]2 pcs car park extract fans ACN 560/280[/TECH].\n\nThese extract fans were equipped with [TECH]4 pcs ducted splitter-silencers[/TECH] on the inlet and outlet sides of the fans to help keep low noise levels. [TECH]4 pcs of CO2 sensors[/TECH] were also provided for automatic control of the jet fans.\n\nAll equipment is controlled with Novenco's Motor Control Panel, which handles all operations of the mechanical car park ventilation system. Annual maintenance of the Novenco car park safety system will be carried out by Novenco Building & Industry. This is due to the system being a life safety system and to ensure it runs correctly.\n\n## [TECH_DOC][View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1162/international-finance-centre-ifc-1-mu15497-0317-gb.pdf)[/TECH_DOC]"

The air is filtered and heated in the units and led to the downstream [SEO]air handling units[/SEO] by means of large fans.\n\n## OPTIMISATION FEATURES\n\n- Fan replacement with high-efficiency speed-controlled [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae axial fans[/TECH]\n- Fan connection to ducts for dynamic pressure recovery\n- Enlargement of the intake and area to reduce pressure drop\n- Duct Connections ensure independent fan operation and a significant increase in redundancy\n- Reduction of number of silencer baffles, due to quieter [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] [SEO]fans[/SEO]\n\n## THE CONCEPT\n\nEven in modern plants, the high dynamic fan pressure is unused and the kinetic energy of the air-flow is lost. This is neither economical nor environmentally friendly in view of the enormous challenges posed by the climate protection targets. With modern [SEO]fans[/SEO], the total pressure and thus the total energy of the air-flow is utilized. As a result, system efficiencies of up to [TECH]85%[/TECH] are achievable.\n[TECH]NOVENCO Building & Industry[/TECH] is your partner in achievement of your climate protection goals at a reasonable cost.\n\n## SUMMARY\n\nThe use of the [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] fan with state-of-the-art components in combination with advanced system concepts proves the huge potential for reduction of the ecological footprint in [SEO]ventilation systems[/SEO]. In the Frankfurt Airport project, fewer [TECH]kWh[/TECH] are consumed, fewer raw materials are used and less [TECH]CO2[/TECH] is emitted in comparition with the old ventilation solution.

Over the past few decades the mine operated to extract salt before it was closed in 1982. It has now been converted into a modern backfill mine and serves to protect the surface through filling up the cavities in the former excavation. For this purpose, more than [TECH]200,000 tons[/TECH] of mineral waste materials are stored every year at a depth of approx. [TECH]700 metres[/TECH]. By using the cavities for the environmentally friendly and long-term safe disposal of mineral waste from municipal and industrial plants, the backfill mine makes a significant and sustainable contribution to environmental protection.\n\n## IMPLEMENTING THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY\n\nFor the latest renovation project at the backfill mine, carried out to improve ventilation systems under the ground, the main contractor **Jeremias\u00ae Chimney Systems** has delivered a specially designed and [TECH]36 m tall[/TECH] chimney together with all steel construction and ductworks. With focus on a sustainable green solution for the project, the [TECH]NOVENCO\u00ae ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] axial flow fan was approved as an obvious choice for the Teutschenthal mine owners. The highly efficient and in [TECH]98% recyclable[/TECH] fan contributed considerably to the achievement of a state subsidy for the project. The [TECH]ZerAx fan, in size \u00d82 m[/TECH], is combined with an [TECH]IE5 class Nidec PM motor type Dyneo+[/TECH] and a [TECH]Danfoss VLT frequency converter[/TECH], which gives the unique configuration of the latest [TECH]EC+[/TECH] fan technology. This highest possible system efficiency is a green solution that goes beyond the requirements of today.\n\n## THE GREENEST WATT IS THE ONE NEVER PRODUCED\n\nHere in the Teutschenthal backfill mine, the [TECH]ZerAx fan with efficiency up to 92%[/TECH] is combined with an [TECH]IE5 class Nidec PM motor[/TECH] and a [TECH]Danfoss VLT frequency converter[/TECH]. The motor power is [TECH]220 kW[/TECH]. In a direct comparison to traditional [TECH]IE3 motors of 220 kW[/TECH], the weight-saving is approx. [TECH]half a ton[/TECH]. Also worth mentioning is that traditional [TECH]4-pole AC motors[/TECH] of the same physical dimensions only have a maximum power of [TECH]132 kW[/TECH]. The implementation of this solution proves that synchronous [TECH]EC+[/TECH] technology can accommodate energy performance with a reduced environmental footprint in the form of less kWh. Less kWh consumed, fewer raw materials used and lower CO\u2082 emissions. Combined with the [TECH]ZerAx fan efficiency of up to 92%[/TECH], [TECH]98% recyclability rate[/TECH] and [TECH]20+ years of lifetime[/TECH] this solution is of great benefit to the environment for many years to come.\n\n[TECH_DOC][View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](/media/6170/teutschenthal-gb-mu-16151-0622.pdf)[/TECH_DOC]"

Further fresh air is supplied through the huge entrance tunnels, which are equipped with in total [TECH]6 pcs NovAx\u2122 AUT-400[/TECH] jet fans which induce further fresh air into the car park facility. The fresh air is distributed throughout the parking levels by means of [TECH]42 pcs of CGF-500[/TECH] centrifugal jet fans. The [TECH]CGF-500[/TECH] jet fans have an installation height of less than [TECH]27 cm[/TECH], ensuring maximum available clearance height in the car park levels. [TECH]Three large NovAx\u2122 ACN-1600[/TECH] axial flow fans, with a total exhaust capacity of [TECH]460,000 m\u00b3/h[/TECH], ensure that the polluted air mixture is safely extracted from the car park. All jet fans were powder coated in the colour white. In combination with the white ceiling and walls, the car park looks and feels really clean and fresh.\n\nNBI also installed large roof cowls on top of the ventilation shafts and ventilation grills on all levels of the ventilation shafts. Through the parent company [TECH]SCHAKO[/TECH], NBI also supplied and installed attenuator baffles, fan isolation dampers and large dampers for the ventilation shafts to balance the ventilation system throughout all parking levels.\n\n## [TECH_DOC][View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1164/nieuw-hoog-catharijne-mu15494-0317-gb.pdf)[/TECH_DOC]"

The completed building occupies more than [TECH]33,000 m\u00b2[/TECH] and has 500 rooms. It is visited annually by 700,000 people and provides a venue for more than 1,000 events a year.\n\n### THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION MUST BE REDUCED\n\nThe Aarhus Concert Hall saves more than [TECH]67,000 EUR[/TECH] in energy expenses and [TECH]170 ton CO2[/TECH] annually with [TECH]Climaster ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH]. [TECH]NOVENCO Building & Industry[/TECH] has delivered more than [TECH]12 air handling units[/TECH] for The Aarhus Concert Hall during the summer of 2011. The delivery was part of a comprehensive energy retrofit of the concert hall, and for this project [TECH]NOVENCO Building & Industry[/TECH] designed the [TECH]Climaster ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH].\n\nThe [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] [SEO]fan[/SEO] is an important corner stone in considerably reducing the energy consumption compared to similar products.\n\n### MINIMUM ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND INDOOR CLIMATE\n\nThe energy improvement on a grand scale happens with the replacement of the [SEO]ventilation[/SEO] unit, or rather [TECH]12 ventilation systems[/TECH] - in the original building. Since its inauguration in 1982, the [SEO]ventilation system[/SEO] ran at full capacity each time an event took place on stage. When the ventilation was used in the halls in the original building, it renewed [TECH]150,000 cubic metres of air per hour[/TECH]. In the Grand Hall this meant that the air was renewed six times per hour. The old units had two settings - on or off. That meant that they used the same amount of power, regardless of whether there were 400 or nearly 1,600 people in the hall.\n\nThrough the years this has cost a lot of energy - to pump fresh and unused air in and out of the hall. With the new [SEO]ventilation system[/SEO] the energy wastage has come to an end, since it has speed regulators for the motors, an air quality gauge and a rotor transmission.\n\n### THERE ARE SEVERAL ADVANTAGES\n\nThe new ventilation equipment in the original part of the Concert Hall is capable of circulating and renewing just as many cubic metres of air as the old equipment. In some areas there will be significant improvements, both on the audience experience and on the Concert Hall's climate account.\n\nThe system is equipped with a sensor and frequency control, based on [TECH]Climaster ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH], containing the [TECH]Novenco Building & Industry[/TECH] highly effective fan with a rate exceeding [TECH]90%[/TECH].\n\nThe air quality in the hall is checked constantly so the unit can replace the air as necessary. Therefore it provides for optimum air quality, regardless if the hall is full or half full. At the same time, the air measurements ensure that fresh, unused air and expensive energy is not squandered.\n\n### FACTS\n\n- [TECH]50% LOWER ENERGY CONSUMPTION PER FAN[/TECH]\n- [TECH]50% REDUCED ENERGY CONSUMPTION ON ALL UNITS COMBINED[/TECH]\n- [TECH]170 TONS REDUCED CO2 EMISSION PER YEAR[/TECH]\n- SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED SOUND LEVEL\n\n### [TECH_DOC][View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1179/aarhus-musikhus-mu-15489-0317-gb.pdf)[/TECH_DOC]"

With the group-wide future program [TECH]\"Strategy 2025\"[/TECH], Volkswagen wants to get fit for the future with the vision of becoming a world-leading provider of sustainable mobility. Sustainable means also responsible care for the environment.\n\nSustainable growth is the basis of medium-term future planning and the associated increase in value and image of any company. In that context, the new generation of air handling units with axial fans can contribute greatly in all areas of ventilation and air conditioning.\n\nSince the beginning of 2017, Volkswagen has been intensively investigating the technical possibilities of high-efficiency axial fans and has carried out a whole series of tests, measurements and practical trials. At the beginning of 2018, it was time for the next step: implementation of the obtained results and knowledge in new air conditioning technology. Two production sites in two countries had air handling units with new technology and highly efficient axial fans installed \u2013 at Porsche in Stuttgart/Zuffenhausen, Germany and at Volkswagen Navarra in Pamplona, Spain.\n\n## PROJECT FACTS\n\n- [TECH]AHU MANUFACTURER: TRUBEL KLIMATECHNIK[/TECH]\n- [TECH]INSTALLATION LOCATION: PAMPLONA, SPAIN[/TECH]\n- [TECH]NUMBERS: 3 AHUs WITH 80,000 m\u00b3/h EACH and 3 AHUs WITH 60,000 m\u00b3/h EACH[/TECH]\n- [TECH]TOTAL CAPACITY: 420,000 m\u00b3/h[/TECH]\n\n## VOLKSWAGEN NAVARRA, PIONEER AND ROLE MODEL FOR THE USE OF SUSTAINABLE VENTILATION TECHNOLOGY\n\nVolkswagen Navarra assumes daily responsibility for the environment, safety and society. Thereby resource management and emissions receive special attention. Through innovation and impressive planning at the site, the goal is to continuously reduce energy consumption and the associated CO\u2082 emissions. For this strategic interest, the new device technology with the new [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] axial fans was deliberately chosen as a solution for the renewal of the ventilation in the assembly hall.\n\n*\"The demands placed on the air conditioning of buildings increase steadily. Axial fans can make a significant contribution to combining technical requirements with sustainable building design. The new trend-setting AHU technology has fully met all expectations.\"*\n\n**Asier Matorell, Factory Planning Manager, Volkswagen Navarra and Axel Rossmannek, Head of Supply Planning Volkswagen Wolfsburg**\n\n## THE VOLKSWAGEN PROJECT\n\nThe ventilation had to be completely renewed for one of the largest production buildings of the factory. Higher air volumes were needed and the space available for the installation of the equipment was insufficient. Therefore, a new installation location for the AHUs had to be found on the roof. The large [TECH]80,000 m\u00b3/h units[/TECH] were placed on a steel platform on the connection between two buildings. In addition to saving energy, the criteria unit size, weight saving and noise reduction were therefore also key requirements.\n\n## A NEW AIR CONDITIONING GENERATION\n\nThe high demands could only be met with the new generation of air handling units, in which the highly efficient axial fans from NOVENCO were optimally utilized. The last equipment was put into operation in mid-December and exceeded all expectations.\n\nThe [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] axial fans currently represent the world's leading fan technology with fan efficiencies of [TECH]up to 92%[/TECH].

Fans consume up to 60% of total electrical consumption in AHU systems, yet this critical component remains largely unaddressed in efficiency improvements.\n\nOur partnership approach enables system integrators to leverage proven fan technology that meets evolving regulatory requirements while delivering measurable performance improvements.\n\n## Independent Performance Validation\n\nWorking with AHU producer Trubel Luft- und Klimatechnik GmbH, we conducted comparative testing in the T\u00dcV S\u00fcd Test Laboratory. Commissioned by one of Germany's largest vehicle manufacturers, tests compared our ZerAx\u00ae axial flow fans against premium plug fan technology using identical testing conditions.\n\n## Verified Performance Results\n\nIndependent testing demonstrated clear advantages of ZerAx\u00ae technology:\n\n- **Energy savings** - 20% reduction in power consumption\n- **Noise reduction** - 3 dB lower sound levels in fan section\n- **Space efficiency** - AHU length 30% shorter than plug fan systems\n- **Fast ROI** - Investment payback in 12-18 months\n\n## Integration cuts construction costs 40%\n\nOur ZerAx\u00ae fans integrate into compact sections that transport air with minimal loss. Traditional plug fans create pressure after airflow deceleration, requiring additional energy to recreate pressure. Our diffuser design minimizes turbulence while maximizing ZerAx\u00ae fan efficiency.\n\n## Integration cuts construction costs 40%\n\nSystem integrators and AHU manufacturers gain:\n\n- **Compact design** reducing overall system footprint\n- **Independent validation** through certified testing protocols\n- **Technical support** for seamless system integration\n- **Regulatory compliance** meeting energy efficiency standards\n\nContact us to integrate proven energy efficient ventilation solutions that deliver measurable performance benefits while meeting evolving regulatory requirements.\n\n## [View the PDF Version with additional information\n",

The focus is on reduction of energy in [SEO]AHU[/SEO] optimisation. This applies in particular to non-residential systems with large air volumes.\n\nIn recent years heat recovery has become very popular in solutions for [SEO]energy efficiency[/SEO]. And with tightening of regulations looking to have significant effect, much has been invested in this sector to even further increase the efficiency. The range of [SEO]fans[/SEO], which consume up to [TECH]60%[/TECH] of the electrical consumption of an AHU system, remains unnoticed though. The strengthening of the Ecodesign Regulation regarding [TECH](SFPlimit values)[/TECH] limitation of the power consumption will definitely change the design of future AHU concepts.\n\n## TWO TESTS, TWO FANS, ONE WINNER\n\nIn cooperation with AHU producer Trubel Luft- und Klimatechnik GmbH, NOVENCO Building & Industry has conducted a comparative performance test in the [TECH]T\u00dcV S\u00fcd Test Laboratory[/TECH]. T\u00dcV S\u00fcd is recognised as the world's leading company for product certifications and approval tests.\n\nThe comparative test was a demand from one of Germany's largest manufacturers of vehicles. Both tests were conducted with identical installation points, measure points, measure units, but with two different fans - a premium plug fan from an unspecified fan manufacturer and the [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] [SEO]axial flow fan[/SEO] from NOVENCO Building & Industry.\n\nA framework of corresponding test series gave some very convincing results, where the [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] fan was the unquestionable winner.\n\n## ZERAX\u00ae PROVES BEST IN TEST\n\nAfter a long test series the results were clear - energy saving of [TECH]20%[/TECH], [TECH]3 dB lower sound levels[/TECH] for the fan section and the complete AHU length more than [TECH]30% shorter[/TECH] than the comparative system with the plug fan. Although the [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] fan technology is a more expensive alternative, the ROI pays back the entire investment in an expected [TECH]12 - 18 months[/TECH]. The answer to the comparatively big difference between the two solutions is in the way the [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] fans integrate in the AHU and operate. The [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] fans fit in very compact fan sections that transport the air to the duct with minimum loss. Although the plug fans also create high pressure, they do so after the airflow is slowed considerably. Hence, a lot of energy is lost and more is required to recreate and raise the pressure. The loss in the [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] diffuser is at a minimum, as it delivers a much less turbulent airflow. Add to this the market-leading [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] fan efficiency and the investment is a sound choice for years to come.\n\n## [TECH_DOC][View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1152/trubel-tuev-mu-15676-0218-gb.pdf)[/TECH_DOC]"

The 280,000 m\u00b2 facility spends over 100 mill. kroner per year on electricity, water, and heating. Ventilation represents the largest operational expense.\n\nThis comprehensive retrofit addressed critical infrastructure challenges through systematic fan replacement. Phase one replaced 35 fans while maintaining full integration with legacy [ventilation systems](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/smoke-control/) from the 1950s and 1960s. Results delivered immediate operational improvements.\n\n\"Our analysis confirms return on investment periods decrease proportionally with fan capacity,\" states J\u00f8rgen S\u00f8feldt, functional manager of plumbing and HVAC systems. \"Our ZerAx\u00ae installations achieve ROI periods of less than twelve months.\"\n\n## Technical Performance Results\n\nLegacy systems operated at 40% efficiency. Our replacement systems deliver 90% efficiency ratings. Advanced engineering eliminates operational noise, permitting removal of acoustic dampening systems and reducing overall resistance.\n\nTotal cost analysis reveals superior long-term value:\n- **Initial investment** - Higher upfront costs offset by operational savings\n- **Lifecycle benefits** - Clear financial advantages over competing systems\n- **Integration capacity** - Seamless compatibility with existing infrastructure\n- **Service guarantees** - Comprehensive support throughout system lifetime\n\n\"Alternative products offer lower acquisition costs than Novenco's systems,\" notes S\u00f8feldt. \"However, lifecycle calculations demonstrate our financial advantages.\"\n\n## Operational Challenge Management\n\nHospital infrastructure operates under variable demand protocols:\n- **Surgical departments** require higher ventilation capacity than administrative areas\n- **Seasonal variations** create additional system management complexity\n- **Capacity expansion** over multiple decades stressed 60 year old infrastructure\n- **Breakdown risk** increased with aging equipment requiring constant maintenance\n\nOur high-efficiency systems reduced operational pressure while maintaining full capacity requirements.\n\n## Performance Verification\n\nThe hospital monetizes CO2 reduction credits through energy partnerships.

The total energy consumption for electricity, water, and heating is above [TECH]100 mill. kroner per year[/TECH]. Within this, the expenses for ventilation are by far the largest expenditure item in the energy field.\n\nThis has led to the completion of the first stage of replacing the old fans. So far [TECH]35 fans[/TECH] have been replaced. These new fans still work in conjunction with the older [ventilation systems](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/smoke-control/) that were installed in the [TECH]1950s[/TECH] and [TECH]1960s[/TECH] \u2013 yet the savings have been significant and immediate.\n\n\"In our experience the ROI is shorter the bigger the fan is, and we have seen that the ROI is down to less than one year for our [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] fans,\" says J\u00f8rgen S\u00f8feldt, who is the functional manager of plumbing and HVAC at the Odense University Hospital.\n\n## EFFICIENCY RATES OF ABOUT 90%\n\nThe old fans have had efficiency rates of as little as about [TECH]40%[/TECH], while the new fans offer around [TECH]90%[/TECH]. They are also so silent that it has been possible to remove the noise locks on the ventilation system, which has reduced the resistance further.\n\n\"On paper there are fans that are cheaper to purchase than [TECH]Novenco's[/TECH]. But if one calculates the total consumption for the entire period, during which we expect to use them, it looks completely different. We have said that we want the product that offers the best efficiency rate. This means, that apart from the energy saving, we also want to be able to incorporate the fans in our existing ventilation system without problems, and service and production guarantees are also important,\" says J\u00f8rgen S\u00f8feldt.\n\n## CONTINUOUSLY INCREASING DEMAND\n\nThe ventilation system of the old university hospital was an on-demand system. For example a surgical department used far less ventilation than offices and the demand was very different for summer and winter. Generally, the demand was continuously increasing because the capacity of the hospital has been continuously increased over the years. This has put the [TECH]60 year old[/TECH] ventilation system under huge pressure, but the pressure and the risk of breakdowns has been reduced significantly with the far more energy-efficient fans.\n\n## SAVINGS WITH SHORT ROI\n\nLike many others, the Odense University Hospital makes use of the possibility of converting the [TECH]CO2 reduction[/TECH] into money through the energy companies. Instead of receiving cash money the company has, however, decided to spend the money for energy consultants, who give advice on how to obtain further savings on the budget.\n\nThere are several indications that further replacement of fans will be prioritised due to the short ROI. \"Knowing that we are moving to a new university hospital in [TECH]2018[/TECH] we are wary of making investments that are too longterm and have too long ROI,\" says J\u00f8rgen S\u00f8feldt.\n\n## FACTS\n\n- [TECH]34% REDUCTION OF THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION[/TECH]\n- [TECH]402 TONS REDUCED CO2 EMISSION PER YEAR[/TECH]\n- [TECH]ROI OF DOWN TO 1 YEAR[/TECH]\n\n## [TECH_DOC][View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1178/odense-universitethospital-mu-15493-0317-gb.pdf)[/TECH_DOC]"

Continuous manual fan operation drives unnecessary power consumption while failing to optimize air quality based on actual CO concentrations.\n\nIn 2001, NOVENCO Building & Industry installed one of the first jet fans systems in the United Kingdom for an enclosed underground car park of a shopping mall in South East England. This car park facility with 1,350 parking spaces operates continuously 24/7. Without intelligent CO detection system integration, manual fan operation resulted in excessive energy consumption over 20 years of operation.\n\n## Advanced ventilation eliminates costly ductwork\n\nOur recommended solution delivered:\n- **Automated CO monitoring system** replacing manual fan controls\n- **Zone-specific activation** targeting only areas requiring ventilation\n- **Real-time response** to actual pollution levels rather than time-based operation\n- **Energy optimization** through intelligent operation protocols\n\nOur autonomous CO detection system continuously monitors CO concentrations using strategically positioned sensors throughout the facility. When threshold values are exceeded, the system activates jet fans only in affected zones, eliminating unnecessary operation in unoccupied areas while maintaining safety standards.\n\n## Independent Validation and Measurement Protocol\n\nIndependent consulting firm Royal HaskoningDHV conducted comprehensive CO measurements before implementation and confirmed maintained air quality standards while achieving substantial operational improvements.\n\nThe rigorous validation process included:\n- **Pre-installation baseline** measurements documenting existing performance\n- **Post-upgrade verification** confirming air quality maintenance\n- **Energy consumption analysis** quantifying operational improvements\n- **Compliance confirmation** meeting all safety and regulatory standards\n\nThe validation demonstrated that our intelligent control system maintains equivalent CO levels compared to continuous operation, while activating fans only when CO concentrations require dilution. This targeted approach delivered measured 85.5% energy saving verified by independent testing.\n\n## Intelligent Control System Performance\n\nOur car park ventilation control system monitors CO levels continuously and responds with zone-specific activation, ensuring optimal air quality.\n\nUpon detecting elevated CO concentration, the system activates jet fans in affected areas while increasing extract capacity in nearest shafts. This coordinated response ensures rapid pollutant removal without unnecessary energy expenditure.\n\nSystem operation features include:\n- **Continuous monitoring** of CO concentrations throughout the facility\n- **Zone-specific activation** targeting only areas requiring ventilation\n- **Variable speed control** optimizing fan operation based on pollution levels\n- **Coordinated extract system** enhancing pollutant removal efficiency\n\nThe jet fans induce surrounding air to ensure optimal mixing of contaminated air with fresh air within targeted zones. Variable speed-controlled exhaust fans remove harmful gases efficiently while adapting to actual ventilation requirements. Our control panels maintain CO concentrations at safe levels while minimizing power consumption through intelligent operation protocols.\n\n### [View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5867/control-system-upgrade-gb-15953-0521.pdf)\n",

Even after [TECH]20 years[/TECH] of constant operation, the [TECH]NOVENCO[/TECH] [SEO]fans[/SEO] still run perfectly. In the absence of a [TECH]CO monitoring system[/TECH], many fans are switched on manually and run 24/7, leading to unnecessary energy consumption. This is far from an optimal solution in today's energy-saving world.\nTo improve the efficiency of the system as a whole, the recommended solution was to refurbish the [SEO]car park[/SEO] with new control panels and a fully automatic [TECH]CO monitoring system[/TECH] to reduce electricity consumption.\n\n### FAST AND EASY UPGRADE RESULTS IN INCREDIBLE ENERGY REDUCTION\n\nBased on the simplicity and robustness of the proposed system, [TECH]NOVENCO[/TECH] was rewarded the contract again, but this time as the supplier of the control system with an autonomous [TECH]CO monitoring system[/TECH].\nThe [TECH]CO detection system[/TECH] continuously monitors [TECH]CO concentrations[/TECH] throughout the car park using strategically positioned sensors. If a threshold value is exceeded, the system triggers a signal to the control panels, which activate the jet fan system only for the area where the increased concentration was measured.\nPrior to replacing the control panels, the main contractor entrusted an independent consulting company, [TECH]Royal HaskoningDHV[/TECH], with carrying out measurements of the [TECH]CO levels[/TECH] in the car park. [TECH]CO measurements[/TECH] were also taken after the upgrade, which were similar to those before the upgrade. The significant difference with the new [TECH]CO detection system[/TECH] was that the fans were only switched on when [TECH]CO concentrations[/TECH] were elevated, whereas they used to be in operation 24/7. Although a reduction in energy consumption was expected, the measurement results showed a staggering [TECH]85.5% energy saving[/TECH].\n\n### INCREDIBLE ENERGY REDUCTION\n\nThe [TECH]NOVENCO[/TECH] [SEO]car park ventilation[/SEO] control system is highly intelligent and monitors the [TECH]CO levels[/TECH] constantly. Upon detection of an increased [TECH]CO concentration[/TECH], the intelligent control system only activates [SEO]jet fans[/SEO] in the affected area and slightly increases the extract capacity in the nearest extract shaft to draw in fresh air and dilute harmful gases.\nThe [SEO]car park[/SEO] [SEO]jet fans[/SEO] induce the surrounding air, making sure that the contaminated air is perfectly mixed with the fresh air within the affected zone. Variable speed-controlled [SEO]exhaust fans[/SEO] remove the unhealthy gases in\nthe affected zones. The newly installed control panels for this [SEO]car park ventilation[/SEO] system are dedicated to keeping [TECH]CO concentrations[/TECH] at very safe levels while minimising power consumption.\n\n### [TECH_DOC][View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5867/control-system-upgrade-gb-15953-0521.pdf)[/TECH_DOC]"

The [SEO]ventilation[/SEO] constitutes [TECH]23%[/TECH] of the total energy consumption at the brewery in Fredericia, and the CO2 reduction contributes with [TECH]0.04 GBP[/TECH] per saved [TECH]kWh[/TECH] in sales of CO2.\n\nTherefore, it was primarily for financial reasons that it was decided to replace the old [SEO]fans[/SEO] installed in the 1970's with new [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] fans. When the first fans were installed, they were not adjusted and therefore ran at constant full capacity in very humid surroundings, in one of the bottling halls that works 24/7. The purpose was to exhaust the moist air and inject dry, warm air.\n\n### THE PROMISED SAVINGS ACHIEVED\n\nAccording to Carlsberg's energy consultant Bjarne Pedersen the promised savings have already been achieved, before the adjustment of the [SEO]ventilation[/SEO]. \"We expect the fans to lead to cost reduction of [TECH]30%[/TECH]. The rest will be obtained through a change in the control of our [SEO]ventilation system[/SEO]. We still need to make the final calculations, but a measurement with a tong test ammeter shows that we are close to attaining the expected savings,\" says Bjarne Pedersen.\n\nThe [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] fan calculation is based on frequency control and therefore the obtained total savings will be higher than the savings calculated for the fan. The replacement of Carlsberg's fans presupposes the following budget data.\n\n- Prior electricity consumption (the old ventilation system): [TECH]890,400 kWh/year[/TECH]\nTheoretical electricity consumption (new fans in the old system): [TECH]451,528 kWh/year[/TECH]\nSaving partly due to the new fans: [TECH]438,872 kWh/year[/TECH]\n- Carlsberg employed a ventilation company to solve the task of replacing the fans and this company has issued an energy savings certificate.\n\n### ROI OF 2 YEARS\n\nThe calculations show that the ROI of the task comprising the consultancy work and the replacement of the entire system including fans is [TECH]2.2 years[/TECH]. The [ventilation system](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/smoke-control/) that has been replaced so far is just one out of approx. [TECH]20[/TECH] ventilation systems. In total, the replacements will reach an amount in the double-digit million range. The replacements started in one end of the brewery and will be made in stages.\n\nThe prerequisite is that the investment on the entire replacement should be recovered within two years, and already now it seems that the savings on just the one ventilation system that has been installed this year will be around [TECH]GBP 49,000[/TECH].\n\nHowever, the work environment is also important to Carlsberg. \"In the bottling halls the noise level is so high that it is absolutely impossible to hear the fans, but it is still evident that these fans move more air than they make noise,\" says Bjarne Pedersen.\n\n### [TECH_DOC][View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1174/carlsberg-mu-15674-0218-gb.pdf)[/TECH_DOC]"

Construction started in [TECH]1937[/TECH] and having opened in [TECH]1942[/TECH]. It is the oldest tunnel in the Netherlands and passes under the Nieuwe Maas river and is located west of the centre of Rotterdam as a part of the Rotterdam Tunnel Traverse. The closed section of the tunnel is [TECH]1,070 metres long[/TECH] and it has [TECH]two tubes, each with two lanes[/TECH]. There is also a separate tube for cyclists and one for pedestrians.\n\n## RE-BUILD THE MONUMENT\n\nThe recent overhaul and upgrade of the tunnel involved both structural and technical aspects, amongst which a major alteration of the tunnel ventilation. The importance and complexity of the job to preserve the monument was further stressed by new regulations. This entailed implementation of a longitudinal ventilation system to create safe conditions for the evacuation of people in the event of a tunnel fire and to provide fire brigades with smoke-free attack routes.\n\n## RELIABILITY FOR LIFE SAFETY\n\n[TECH]NOVENCO Building & Industry[/TECH] supplied and installed [SEO][tunnel fans](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/tunnel-fans/)[/SEO] firstly as a temporary measure during the construction phase and subsequently also for permanent use. The installation consists of [TECH]NOVENCO\u00ae[/TECH]'s round [SEO]tunnel fans[/SEO] type [TECH]AUR 1250[/TECH] and rectangular fans type [TECH]ARC 710[/TECH], which are specially designed, space-saving [SEO]jet fans[/SEO] for tunnel profiles with minimal available installation height. In conditions where installation space for tunnel jet fans is limited, the [TECH]NOVENCO\u00ae[/TECH] rectangular fans play an essential role when designing ventilation and smoke control solutions. And last but not least, the rectangular range of tunnel jet fans provide a lower sound level, which ensures better conditions and driving comfort in the tunnels.\nBoth installed tunnel jet fan types are well known for an uncompromising quality and more importantly, reliable in case of fire.\nThe re-opening of the Maastunnel after two years of reconstruction and renovation aroused a lot of interest around. As it was stated in the Dutch newspaper AD: 'The Maastunnel passed its final exams. In case of fire, there will occur a storm' and in this case the storm is guaranteed by [TECH]NOVENCO\u00ae[/TECH]'s reliable jet fans.\n\n## EQUIPMENT DELIVERY\n\nThe system supplied and installed by [TECH]NOVENCO Building & Industry[/TECH] is a mechanical ventilation system which executed as a longitudinal ventilation and ventilates in traffic direction.

                "category": "News",
                "untagged": "# Certified variable speed packages for safer and\n\n## Engineering Challenges in Modern Smoke Control\n\nBuilding consultants face critical decisions when specifying smoke control systems. Traditional installations compromise safety performance and operational costs through oversized electrical infrastructure.\n\nStandard smoke control fans operate at fixed speeds, creating suboptimal performance across varying building requirements. This forces engineers to oversize systems, resulting in:\n\n- **Higher capital costs** through oversized electrical infrastructure\n- **Increased energy consumption** from inefficient fixed-speed operation\n- **Limited operational flexibility** during normal ventilation modes\n- **Complex control systems** requiring additional bypass equipment\n\nThe 2015 revision of the European standard for powered smoke control fans introduced new specification opportunities. Variable speed drives (VSD) can now be integrated with smoke fans for fire scenarios, opening possibilities for safer and more energy-efficient solutions.\n\nCertified smoke fan and VSD packages remain underspecified. The three specification pathways enable engineers to optimize both safety and efficiency.\n\n## Advanced ventilation eliminates costly ductwork\n\nThe EN 12101-3 standard revision in 2015 established three distinct specification approaches for smoke fans in high-rise buildings, car parks and tunnels. Each option presents different technical requirements and cost implications:\n\n### Option 1: Standard Nominal Speed Operation\n\nThis operates the smoke fan at nominal motor speed without VSD control during emergencies. Engineers specify only a certified smoke fan. A VSD can be installed for normal ventilation but must be bypassed during fire scenarios.\n\nOperational limitations include:\n- **Reduced flexibility** in smoke extraction control\n- **Additional control equipment** for bypass functionality\n- **Higher system complexity** within control panels\n- **Increased installation costs** for bypass mechanisms\n\n### Option 2: Non-Certified VSD Integration\n\nThis uses a smoke fan with VSD not tested as a certified package. Compliance requires motor power de-rating by 20% for safe emergency operation.\n\nTechnical requirements include:\n- **Motor de-rating** by 20% for compliance\n- **Waveform filters** between frequency converter and motor\n- **Oversized power supplies** to accommodate power reserves\n- **Enhanced emergency systems** for the additional power requirements\n\nThese requirements increase system costs considerably. The VSD, emergency power supply and cabling must accommodate the 20% power reserve.\n\n### Option 3: Certified Package Solution\n\nEngineers specify a certified smoke fan with VSD package where the complete assembly undergoes testing and certification. This enables full utilization without de-rating requirements.\n\nCertified packages provide:\n- **Full power utilization** without de-rating penalties\n- **Comprehensive testing** at smoke temperatures\n- **Regulatory compliance** through certified performance\n- **Optimal operational flexibility** for all scenarios\n\n## Integration cuts construction costs 40%\n\nCertified packages enable facility managers to specify variable speed-controlled fans optimized for fire scenarios. This delivers maximum reliability while reducing operational costs.\n\nModern building trends toward increased height make reliable smoke ventilation specifications critical. Systems must create safe escape routes, assist fire brigade operations, and protect building infrastructure.\n\nKey advantages of certified packages include:\n- **Enhanced safety performance** through tested integration\n- **Reduced system complexity** without bypass requirements\n- **Lower total ownership costs** through optimized power sizing\n- **Improved operational flexibility** for normal and emergency modes\n\n![Smoke control fan testing at high temperature with variable speed drives](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/maqlfct3/novenco-zerax-smoke-fan-plus-vsd-high-temp-test.jpg?rmode=max&width=500)\n_Smoke control fan testing at MPA Braunschweig with VSD_\n\n## Operational Efficiency Through Dual-Purpose Design\n\nFrequency converters enable precise fan operation across all flow rates, creating dual-purpose systems with VSD capability. These provide normal ventilation and smoke extraction functionality.\n\nEuropean regulations specify that options 1 and 2 apply to non-certified VSD integration. Certified packages ensure regulatory compliance while maximizing efficiency.\n\nJos Wissink, Business Development Manager at NOVENCO Building & Industry, explains: _\"High-efficiency fans with VSD are now available as certified packages for smoke extraction. This enables facility managers to specify more cost-effective solutions: maximum energy savings and state-of-the-art smoke ventilation in one integrated system.\"_\n\n## System Design and Cost Optimization\n\nHigh-efficiency smoke fans enable downsizing of electrical infrastructure. Engineers achieve cost reductions through optimized system sizing.\n\nInfrastructure benefits include:\n- **Smaller power cables** due to reduced current requirements\n- **Downsized power supplies** for normal and emergency operation\n- **Reduced UPS capacity** requirements\n- **Lower electrical installation costs** through optimized sizing\n\nWhile certified package installation costs may exceed alternatives initially, total lifetime costs reduce significantly. Engineers should evaluate total costs rather than individual components.\n\nComparing our product range illustrates these advantages. With identical selection parameters, the electrical power requirement for our NovAx\u2122 ACN 1250 F300 is 65kW versus 56kW for our high-efficiency ZerAx\u00ae AZN 1250.\n\nThis 14% power consumption difference delivers:\n- **Lower running costs** through reduced energy consumption\n- **Smaller UPS systems** with 14% reduced capacity\n- **Reduced sound levels** for improved building acoustics\n- **Lower maintenance requirements** through optimized design\n\n## Technical Performance Specifications\n\nEfficiency levels directly impact operational costs, CO\u2082 emissions and environmental performance when specifying certified fan and VSD packages. Our NOVENCO ZerAx\u00ae axial flow fan achieves efficiency levels up to 92% with an impressive 98% recyclability rate after more than 20 years in operation.\n\nPerformance characteristics include:\n- **92% maximum efficiency** for reduced energy consumption\n- **98% recyclability** documented by Stena Recycling\n- **Optimized aerodynamic design** for minimal sound generation\n- **Reduced silencing requirements** in normal ventilation modes\n\nThe aerodynamic design achieves extremely low sound levels. Reduced silencing requirements enable smaller attenuators or omission, reducing system resistance and power requirements.\n\n## Safety and Reliability Standards\n\nThe primary advantage lies in proven reliability of our ZerAx\u00ae smoke fans with Danfoss VLT\u00ae frequency converters. These certified installations deliver performance when occupant safety depends on operation.\n\nEmergency system failure endangers lives. Testing and certification at elevated temperatures provides engineering assurance. Our ZerAx\u00ae and Danfoss VLT\u00ae package delivers:\n\n- **Safe escape routes** for building occupants\n- **Fire brigade operational support** through reliable smoke clearance\n- **Property protection** through effective smoke management\n- **Long-duration operation** under extreme temperature conditions\n\nReliability forms the foundation of smoke control specification. Certified solutions guarantee operation during extended scenarios where failure is not an option.\n\n## Contact our integration specialists today\n\nFor detailed technical specifications, compliance documentation and system design support for your next project, contact our engineering consultants today. Our team provides comprehensive assistance for smoke control system specification and implementation.\n\nCall +45 4814 3333 or email sales@novenco.com to discuss your specific smoke control requirements and obtain technical documentation.\n\n_NOVENCO designs, develops and manufactures ventilation products and systems used in applications worldwide. NOVENCO is a certified smoke control company and member of the Smoke Control Association (SCA). The complete range of our NOVENCO ZerAx\u00ae HT fans has been tested and certified as smoke fans in combination with Danfoss VLT\u00ae drives according to EN 12101-3:2015 by MPA in Braunschweig, Germany._\n",

This opened up new possibilities for safer, greener and more economical solutions. But even so, the certified [SEO]smoke fan[/SEO] and [TECH]VSD[/TECH] packages are still to be discovered by many.*\n\nIncreasing the safety of a high-rise building, a [SEO]car park[/SEO] or [SEO]tunnel[/SEO] and at the same time reducing the running costs with more [SEO]energy-efficient[/SEO] operation would be an exciting route to explore for many. With the changes in [TECH]2015[/TECH] to the [TECH]EN 12101-3[/TECH] standard for powered smoke and heat control fans, this became a scenario within reach. The standard lays out three options:\n\n1. Run the smoke fan at nominal motor speed without [TECH]VSD[/TECH]. For this, you only need a certified smoke fan. You can use a [TECH]VSD[/TECH], but this [TECH]VSD[/TECH] must be bypassed in case of a fire. This means you can only run the smoke exhaust at the nominal motor speed, which limits the flexibility for smoke operation significantly. Furthermore, the bypass option requires additional (costly) control equipment within the control panel.\n\n2. Use a smoke fan with [TECH]VSD[/TECH], which have not been tested and certified as a package. With this set-up, you have to de-rate the motor power by [TECH]20%[/TECH]. Furthermore, you need an additional waveform filter between the frequency converter and the motor, which adds considerably to the costs. The costs will further increase since the [TECH]VSD[/TECH], emergency power supply and cabling also have to be designed for the [TECH]20%[/TECH] extra power reserve.\n\n3. Use a certified smoke fan with [TECH]VSD[/TECH] package, where the complete package is tested and certified for smoke and heat control systems. This solution enables you to use the full potential of the complete package.\n\nThe last option, a certified package with a smoke fan and frequency converter, allows the facility managers to use variable speed-controlled fans in the event of fires. The outcome? Maximum reliability in combination with reduced operating costs and flexibility to control the smoke control and extraction.\n\nIn a real estate market with a tendency to build higher and higher, the requirements for reliable smoke ventilation systems becomes equally higher. The need for ventilation systems that create safe escape routes, assist the fire brigade in smoke extraction and protect the building are a critical factor.\n\n![Smoke control fan testing at high temperature with variable speed drives](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/maqlfct3/novenco-zerax-smoke-fan-plus-vsd-high-temp-test.jpg?rmode=max&width=500)\n*Smoke control fan testing at [TECH]MPA Braunschweig[/TECH] with [TECH]VSD[/TECH]*\n\n**From wasting to saving energy**\n\nUsing frequency converters allows you to operate the fan at all possible flow rates. In effect, the fans become dual-purpose fans with a [TECH]VSD[/TECH]. They can be used for normal ventilation purposes, and they can operate as smoke extraction fans in case of fires. In the EU, the above options 1 and 2 apply to smoke fans, which are not certified together with a [TECH]VSD[/TECH]. But when you choose a certified smoke fan and frequency drive package, you know that it complies with the rules in force.\n\nJos Wissink, Business Development Manager at [TECH]NOVENCO Building & Industry[/TECH], says: *\"As high-efficiency fans with [TECH]VSD[/TECH] are now available as a certified package for smoke extraction, facility managers have the possibility for a more profitable set-up: maximum energy savings and state-of-the-art smoke ventilation system all in one solution\"*.\n\n**Going green: additional cost-saving benefits**\n\nSince the power consumption is reduced with high-efficiency smoke fans, the necessary power supply and related costs to the power supply systems can be scaled down. In addition to the energy savings, you can reach further initial cost savings through smaller power cables and a reduction of the normal and emergency power supply system costs.\n\nEven though the installation costs of a certified package with a smoke fan and frequency converter may be higher than other alternatives, the initial total investment costs and running costs are reduced to a degree that makes the investment highly attractive. The key is to look at the total lifetime costs \u2013 and not just one element in the package.\n\nFor example, a comparison of the same system shows the differences between industry standard solutions such as the [TECH]NOVENCO NovAx\u2122[/TECH] range of axial smoke fans and the high-efficiency range of [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae smoke fans[/TECH]. With all selection variables set to the same setting, the electrical power input requirement for the [TECH]NovAx\u2122 ACN 1250 F300[/TECH] is [TECH]65kW[/TECH] versus [TECH]56kW[/TECH] for the [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae AZN 1250[/TECH]. The difference in power consumption is almost [TECH]14%[/TECH] which will lead to considerably lower running costs. Furthermore, power supply equipment, including [TECH]UPS[/TECH] systems, can be dimensioned [TECH]14%[/TECH] smaller, resulting in lower initial investment costs. And with a considerably lower sound level, the [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] is the obvious choice.\n\n**High efficiency and low sound levels**\n\nOne of the most interesting features when choosing a certified fan and [TECH]VSD[/TECH] package is the efficiency level. It impacts the operating costs, reduces [TECH]CO\u2082[/TECH] emissions and benefits the environment. [TECH]NOVENCO's ZerAx\u00ae axial flow fan[/TECH] reaches efficiency levels up to [TECH]92%[/TECH] and an impressive [TECH]98%[/TECH] recyclability rate after more than [TECH]20 years[/TECH] in operation as documented in a Recyclability Analysis by [TECH]Stena Recycling[/TECH]. This makes it the most efficient and probably also the most sustainable dual-purpose fan on the market today.\n\nAt the same time, as a result of the optimal aerodynamic design, the fan has extremely low sound levels. For normal ventilation modes, you require less silencing, and the attenuators can be smaller \u2013 or even omitted. This results in lower system resistance and, therefore, even less power is needed. Essentially, both installation costs and running costs are affected positively.\n\n**When safety is the first priority**\n\nSome might say that the cost reductions are an added bonus. The main advantage is that you can count on the highly reliable [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae smoke fans[/TECH] with [TECH]Danfoss VLT\u00ae frequency converters[/TECH] to do the job, they are designed to do: operate as a certified emergency system that never fails.\n\nIf your emergency system fails, human lives are at risk and knowing that the smoke fan is tested and certified for operation at hot smoke temperatures gives peace of mind. With the [TECH]ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] and [TECH]Danfoss VLT\u00ae[/TECH] package, you create safe escape routes for the occupants, assist the fire brigade in firefighting and protect the property. Reliability is at the core and choosing a certified solution guarantees that the fans can endure long-duration smoke and heat exhaust situations.\n\nWhen safety is your first priority, a certified smoke fan and [TECH]VSD[/TECH] package is the natural choice simply because it is reliable in every aspect.\n\n---\n\n*[TECH]NOVENCO[/TECH] designs, develops and manufactures ventilation products and systems used in a range of applications all around the world.

Manufacturing energy is wasted when materials reach landfill rather than being recycled, contributing directly to greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nOur sustainable green fans address the take-make-waste approach through:\n\n- **Third-party verified recyclability** - Independent analysis confirms performance\n- **Extended product lifetimes** - Robust engineering reduces replacement needs\n- **Climate-friendly manufacturing** - Optimized processes minimize environmental impact\n- **Material utilization optimization** - Precision specifications reduce waste\n\n## Third-Party Verified Sustainable Fan Performance\n\nThe NOVENCO\u00ae ZerAx\u00ae fan demonstrates systematic application of design for recycling principles.\n\nIndependent recyclability analysis by Stena Recycling A/S in 2020 verified our ZerAx fans achieve a 98% recyclability rating. Virtually all materials can be recycled according to established waste management protocols.\n\nManufacturing optimization delivers:\n\n- **Documented production processes** - Specifications ensure greener manufacturing\n- **Precision engineering** - Minimized material waste through controlled design\n- **Enhanced waste protocols** - Improved sorting and recovery systems\n- **Supply chain specifications** - Environmental requirements for partners\n- **Pollution reduction** - Controlled manufacturing processes\n\n## Technical Documentation and Compliance\n\nOur position as a leading supplier of sustainable fans is supported by third-party verification and systematic environmental engineering.

We applied the recycling design principles because the energy used to manufacture components go to waste when materials are sent to landfill rather than recycled, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Being that we are environmentally ambitous, we wanted to do better.\n\nSome of the aspects that make our products a green answer to the take-make-waste approach are:\n\n- high recyclability ratings\n- long product lifetimes\n- climate-friendly manufacturing\n- optimised use of materials\n\n### A green [SEO]fan[/SEO] with [TECH]98% recyclability rate[/TECH]\n\nThe [TECH]NOVENCO\u00ae ZerAx\u00ae[/TECH] [SEO]fan[/SEO] is a perfect example of how we apply design for recycling into the manufacturing of products.\n\nA recyclability analysis by [TECH]Stena Recycling A/S[/TECH] in [TECH]2020[/TECH] showed that the [TECH]ZerAx[/TECH] fans had a [TECH]98% recyclability rating[/TECH], which means that close to all the materials in these fans can be recycled.\n\nBy rethinking our development and manufacturing patterns, we were able to:\n\n- make our production processes greener\n- minimise scrap\n- improve waste sorting\n- define environmental specifications for suppliers and partners\n- minimise pollution\n\n<!-- Video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/D309FJKFj-g -->\n\n### Curbing climate change\n\nThe steps we have taken underpin our position as the leading green fan supplier, but we do more and continue to fight the climate changes to reduce gas emissions and protect and preserve our natural resources, as our products and solutions are designed for a sustainable future.\n\n## Downloads\n\n### Case\n\n[TECH_DOC]- [Better results through increased upcycling of materials](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/4330/stena-recycling-and-novenco-building-industry-case-gb.pdf)[/TECH_DOC]"
