In case of fires, the jet fans double-function as invaluable aids for the fire-fighting services and help contain and control the spread of smoke.\n\nThe NOVENCO experience with the NOVENCO NovAx\u2122-based design, manufacture and installation of tunnel fans dates back to the 1980s. The ventilation principles remain unchanged today, as induction of impulses sets air in motion and push it through the tunnels longitudinally.\n\nVentilation system designs with tunnel jet fans are ductless and may include auxiliary fans for supply and exhaust of air. The systems have low construction cost and good space utilisation.\n\nThe NOVENCO tunnel jet fan series are available as unidirectional or reversible units. All versions include silencers.

Traditional systems consume valuable space and increase construction complexity.\n\n## Ductless ventilation reduces construction costs\n\nNOVENCO\u00ae car park fans deliver comprehensive car park ventilation for compact and large facilities.

In critical situations, where fires are blazing, the jet fans double-function as invaluable aids for fire-fighting services and help contain and control the spread of smoke.  \n  \nVentilation of roofed facilities, such as underground car parks, car park tower blocks etc. by induction of air impulses was pioneered by NOVENCO in the 1990s with the introduction of the world\u2019s first jet fans for car parks. The application of the principle in enclosed or semi-open car park facilities has indeed proved to be economical and very efficient.   \nThe ductless ventilation systems for car parks are unique as the jet fans simply push the air through the facilities and to the exhaust fans.   \nFans for supply and exhaust of air are often part of the car park layout designs.\n\nVentilation solutions with jet fans lower the construction cost and optimise the space utilisation.  \n  \nThe NOVENCO car park jet fan series are available as unidirectional or reversible units and include versions with silencers or with silencing technology. The range of sizes and capacities cover low to medium thrusts.\n\n![Above ERP compliance certificate](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/4286/erp_logo-01.png?rmode=max&width=150&height=143)![EN 12101-3:2015 certified](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/4287/en12101-icon.png?rmode=max&width=156&height=149)\n\nSee also: Our\u00a0[Centrifugal Fans](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/centrifugal-fans/)\n\n![Jet Fans AUZ-ARP]()\n\nJet Fans AUZ-ARP\n\nOval design car park jet fans in a unidirectional (AUZ) and fully reversible (ARP) version.

Traditional ducted systems consume ceiling space and complicate structural design.\n\nOval design car park jet fans in unidirectional (AUZ) and fully reversible (ARP) configurations. The range excels in low noise performance with minimal installation height of 422mm.\n\nKey advantages include:\n- **Compact design** - Reduces installation complexity\n- **Extended service life** - Robust construction for demanding applications\n- **Quiet operation** - Acoustic optimisation for noise-sensitive environments\n\n## Precision-engineered components\n\nThe fans incorporate round casings with integrated flanges and dual oval silencers. Aerodynamically optimised guide vanes maximise efficiency while reducing energy consumption.\n\nConstruction details:\n- **Unidirectional models** - Inlet wire guards and discharge deflectors\n- **Reversible versions** - Deflectors on both sides for bi-directional operation\n- **Mounting options** - Standard ceiling or wall installation\n\nCast aluminium impeller blades mount at engineered pitch angles on the central hub. Direct motor coupling eliminates transmission losses. All units receive balancing per VDI 2060, ISO 1940, 1-1986 Class Q 6.3 standards.\n\n## Motor technology and protection\n\nTwo-speed 3x400V, 50Hz or 3x380V, 60Hz motors with direct start capability. Protection rating min. IP55 meets IEC 34-5 standards. Insulation class F or H provides temperature protection.\n\nStandard construction uses hot-dip galvanised steel for casings and frames.

Installing these fan smoke sets with a free outlet (arrangement C) causes additional loss of dynamic pressure in the fan outlet. By fitting a diffuser on the outlet, some of this dynamic pressure loss is recovered as static pressure.

OEMs face increasing demands for energy-efficient solutions while maintaining competitive pricing and reliable performance. Success requires reliable partners who deliver proven energy efficiency, superior system integration, and comprehensive technical support.\n\nOur environmentally friendly EC+ concept, developed through strategic partnership between Danfoss and NOVENCO, represents the market's most advanced response to energy efficiency demands. This comprehensive system solution for AHUs achieves unmatched overall efficiencies of 85% - outperforming competitive solutions by significant margins while reducing total cost of ownership.\n\nThe EC+ concept specifically targets HVAC system efficiency optimisation through integrated component design. The proven solution combines NOVENCO ZerAx\u00ae high-efficiency axial flow fans, premium IE4 and IE5 permanent magnet (PM) motors, and intelligent Danfoss VLT\u00ae frequency converters in optimised configurations.\n\n## System efficiency optimisation\n\nTechnical compatibility drives OEM success across market applications. The EC+ system delivers motor and frequency converter efficiencies above 95% through optimised component matching. Combined with ZerAx fan efficiency of 92%, total system efficiency reaches 85% under real-world operating conditions.\n\nThis performance represents 20-25 percentage points improvement over alternative solutions, including direct-driven centrifugal plug fans with EC motors. No other AHU system solution matches this efficiency level while maintaining operational reliability.\n\n### Compact design benefits for OEM integration\n\nHigh ZerAx efficiency enables AHU designs up to 30% shorter and 30% lighter while maintaining identical performance characteristics. This optimisation reduces material costs, shipping expenses, and installation space requirements for end users.\n\nZerAx fans provide complete plug-and-play integration with standardised mounting interfaces. This approach simplifies assembly processes, reduces installation complexity, and accelerates production scheduling. Sound levels remain significantly lower than competitive solutions, addressing stringent end-user acoustic requirements effectively.\n\nExtended 20+ year operational lifetimes contribute to sustainability goals while guaranteeing minimal maintenance requirements throughout the product lifecycle, reducing total cost of ownership for end customers.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the EC+ Efficiency Equation](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5979/ecplus-equation.jpg?rmode=max&width=757&height=368)\n\n## Dynamic pressure technology advantage\n\nEnergy-efficient ventilation systems require comprehensive pressure utilisation. HVAC systems limited to static pressure cannot exceed 90% efficiency, as dynamic pressure energy dissipates wastefully.\n\nMaximum system efficiency demands fans that harness both static and dynamic pressures. This approach delivers higher efficiency, reduced energy consumption, lower operating costs, and decreased carbon emissions.\n\nTraditional plug and centrifugal fan calculations rely solely on static pressure. These fans cannot utilise dynamic pressure, which literally disappears. Axial fans utilise both static and dynamic pressures, enabling total pressure calculations and efficiencies above 90%.\n\nWhile plug and centrifugal fans appear simpler and offer flexible configurations, they become expensive choices in both operating costs and environmental impact. High-efficiency axial fans consume substantially less energy, reducing costs and carbon emissions. Efficiency becomes the critical parameter for intelligent fan solution selection.\n\n![Illustration of airflow in a centrifugal fan](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5980/still_flow_centrifugalfan_web.jpg?rmode=max&width=564)\n\n![Illustration of a flow in centrifugal fan system](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5981/still_flow_4xplugfan_web.jpg?rmode=max&width=564)\n\n![Light blue pattern illustrating air flow in a centrifugal fan](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5982/still_flow_axialfan_web.jpg?rmode=max&width=564)\n\n_Airflow comparison: centrifugal fan, plug fans, and NOVENCO ZerAx axial fan_\n\n## Advanced ZerAx engineering\n\nMost centrifugal fans achieve efficiencies between 65-70%. Standard axial flow fans typically perform at 80%. This significant difference stems from airflow patterns through the fan.\n\nAxial flow fans maintain airflows parallel to the fan axis. Centrifugal fans create perpendicular airflows to the fan axis, losing most velocity energy through this design.\n\nMinimal losses in axial fans result from aerodynamic design creating straight airflows with negligible turbulence. This fundamental design difference provides consistently higher efficiency levels.\n\nNOVENCO ZerAx axial flow fans achieve unmatched efficiencies up to 92%. These performance levels establish new industry benchmarks, reducing overall power consumption and operational sound levels. ZerAx axial fans represent today's most energy-efficient ventilation solution.\n\n## OEM partnership programme\n\nSystem compatibility requires comprehensive technical support throughout the development cycle. The dedicated OEM partnership programme provides detailed integration specifications, performance documentation, application engineering support, and ongoing technical collaboration for successful product launches.\n\nContact the integration specialists at NOVENCO to discuss specific system requirements and application challenges. The experienced technical team collaborates closely with OEM partners to optimise performance, reduce development costs, and accelerate time-to-market while ensuring compliance with industry standards.\n\n<!-- Downloads Section -->\n\n### Downloads\n\n**Brochures:**\n\n- [EC+ Concept](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1664/novenco-danfoss-ecplus-gb-mu-15951-1121.pdf)\n- [EC+ UPGRADES](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/xsmppi0x/ecplus-upgrade-mu-15952-0425.pdf)\n- [Best possible fan for AHUs](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/3jpbhaxf/novenco-best-possible-fan-for-ahu-gb-mu-16156-0425.pdf)\n\n**Cases:**\n\n- [DS Group](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/6129/ds-group-gb-mu-16166-0522.pdf)\n- [Keppel Bay Tower](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5742/keppel-bay-tower-gb-mu-16059-0121.pdf)\n- [Automotive industry](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5752/automotive-industry-mu-16062-0221-gb.pdf)\n- [VW Navarra](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/2110/vw-navarra-mu-15863-0319-gb.pdf)\n- [JK Tyres](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1981/jk-tyres-mu-15711-0918-gb.pdf)\n- [Innovative AHU concepts](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1152/trubel-tuev-mu-15676-0218-gb.pdf)\n\n## Related products\n\n- [Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZL](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-zerax-azl/)\n- [Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZN-AZW](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-zerax-azn-azw/)\n- [Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZL-AZN Standard Ranges](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-zerax-azl-azn-standard-ranges/)\n\n## Related solutions\n\n- [AHU fans](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/ahu-fans/)\n- [Data centres](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/data-centres/)\n- [Retrofits](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/retrofits/)",

The environmentally friendly EC+ concept developed in close cooperation between Danfoss and NOVENCO is the latest market response to growing demands for energy saving. This most efficient system solutions for AHUs are miles ahead of the competition with unmatched overall system efficiencies of 85%. The EC+ concept, that is specifically conceived to increase the efficiencies of HVAC systems, comprises the NOVENCO ZerAx\u00ae series of high efficiency axial fans, high efficiency IE4 and IE5 permanent magnet (PM) motors and the intelligent and high efficiency Danfoss VLT\u00ae frequency drives.\n\n### EC+ system efficiency and compact AHU system design\n\nWith motor and frequency drive efficiencies both reaching above 95%, the ZerAx fan efficiency of 92% brings the overall system efficiency to an impressing 85%. This is 20-25 percentage points better than the closest alternative solutions, such as direct-driven centrifugal plug fans with EC motors. It is the highest possible overall system efficiency for AHUs available on the market. Because of the high efficiencies of the ZerAx, it is possible to design AHUs up to 30% shorter and 30% lighter and still have the same performance characteristics and hence cut expenditures. The ZerAx fans for AHUs are complete plug-and-play solutions to ensure easy and fast installation. The fan sound levels are significantly lower than those from other fan manufacturers. The fan lifetimes are 20+ years, which contribute to sustainability and guarantee low maintenance costs.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the EC+ Efficiency Equation](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5979/ecplus-equation.jpg?rmode=max&width=757&height=368)\n\n### Dynamic pressure is the keyword\n\nHVAC systems which only utilise the static pressure cannot achieve efficiencies above 90%, as the dynamic pressure goes to waste. To maximise the energy efficiency of any ventilation system, fans must use both static and dynamic pressures. The result is higher efficiency, lower energy consumption, reduced operating costs and lower carbon emissions.\n\nThe efficiencies of plug and centrifugal fans, as used in many HVAC systems, are calculated solely on the basis of the static pressure. This is because these fans are unable to utilise the dynamic pressure, which literally disappears into thin air. Axial fans on the other hand utilise both the static and the dynamic pressures, which allows for calculations based on the total pressure. Efficiencies above 90% are then achievable, as less energy goes to waste.\n\nAlthough plug and centrifugal fans appear simpler and are more flexible constructions than axial fans, they turn quickly out to be expensive choices \u2013 both in terms of operating costs and the environmental impact. High efficiency axial fans consume much less energy, reduce cost and carbon emissions, which makes efficiency a critical key parameter in the choice of fan solution.\n\n![Illustration of airflow in a centrifugal fan](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5980/still_flow_centrifugalfan_web.jpg?rmode=max&width=564)\n\n![Illustration of a flow in centrifugal fan system](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5981/still_flow_4xplugfan_web.jpg?rmode=max&width=564)\n\n![Light blue pattern illustrating air flow in a centrifugal fan](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5982/still_flow_axialfan_web.jpg?rmode=max&width=564)\n\n*Difference in airflow between a centrifugal fan, plug fans and the NOVENCO ZerAx axial fan*\n\n### ZerAx and ground-breaking fan efficiencies\n\nMany centrifugal fans reach efficiencies between 65-70%, while axial fans usually perform at up to 80%. A main reason for the significant difference is in the way the air moves through the fan. In axial fans the airflows are parallel to the fan axis, whereas in centrifugal fans they flow perpendicular to the fan axis and thereby lose most of the velocity energy.\n\nThe minimum loss in axial fans is due to the aerodynamic design that gives straight airflows with no or very little turbulence. This difference in design generally provides higher efficiency levels in axial fans.\n\nThe NOVENCO ZerAx axial fans have unmatched fan efficiencies of up to 92%. These efficiencies push fan designs to new levels, and thus lower the overall power consumption and sound. ZerAx axial fans are the most energy-efficient on the market today.\n\n<!-- Downloads Section -->\n### Downloads\n\n**Brochures:**\n- [EC+ Concept](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1664/novenco-danfoss-ecplus-gb-mu-15951-1121.pdf)\n- [EC+ UPGRADES](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/xsmppi0x/ecplus-upgrade-mu-15952-0425.pdf)\n- [Best possible fan for AHUs](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/3jpbhaxf/novenco-best-possible-fan-for-ahu-gb-mu-16156-0425.pdf)\n\n**Cases:**\n- [DS Group](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/6129/ds-group-gb-mu-16166-0522.pdf)\n- [Keppel Bay Tower](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5742/keppel-bay-tower-gb-mu-16059-0121.pdf)\n- [Automotive industry](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5752/automotive-industry-mu-16062-0221-gb.pdf)\n- [VW Navarra](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/2110/vw-navarra-mu-15863-0319-gb.pdf)\n- [JK Tyres](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1981/jk-tyres-mu-15711-0918-gb.pdf)\n- [Innovative AHU concepts](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1152/trubel-tuev-mu-15676-0218-gb.pdf)\n\n## Related Products\n\n- [Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZL](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-zerax-azl/)\n- [Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZN-AZW](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-zerax-azn-azw/)\n- [Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZL-AZN Standard Ranges](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-zerax-azl-azn-standard-ranges/)\n\n## Related Solutions\n\n- [AHU fans](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/ahu-fans/)\n- [Data centres](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/data-centres/)\n- [Retrofits](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/retrofits/)"

Therefore, more and more car parks are being built; both below and above ground. As a supplier of fans for road tunnels, NOVENCO has a great expertise with design and development in close cooperation with the authorities.\n\n![An expansive, vacant car park featuring bright ceiling lights,](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1137/nhc-20161216-_r5a8561.jpg?rmode=max&width=564)\n\nIn the early 90s, the Dutch consultant \u2013 J. van Toorenburg BV \u2013 faced a challenging project in The Hague, where a car park was layout much like a traffic tunnel. For ventilation, they came up with a solution using small jet fans. As a supplier of larger jet fans for road tunnels, Novenco was asked to develop and install these compact jet fans. From thereon, Novenco has pioneered and set new industrial standards for the ventilation of closed car parks. These thrust ventilation systems for underground car parks and delivery bays are among our fundamental technologies and expertise. From the start our car park ventilation solutions with the small and very compact jet fans revolutionized the market for parking facilities. These car park jet fans have long since shown to be invaluable assets for optimal ventilation for the emission of toxic exhaust gases and smoke removal in case of a fire inside the car park.\n\nIn enclosed car parks, mechanical ventilation is necessary to keep the level of hazardous gases such as carbon monoxide (CO) to a minimum. By using jet fans, these ventilation systems can be designed without the use of bulky ductwork. The small car park jet fans are strategically positioned and can ventilate large areas of the car park by means of induction. In combination with low-pressure axial flow fans to supply fresh air and extract the contaminated air, these jet-ventilation systems are suitable for efficient ventilation of any car park.\n\nA ventilation system with jet fans offers numerous advantages over conventional ducted ventilation systems:\n\n- Space saving; the function of complex ductwork in the car park, taking up valuable space which is already restricted, is replaced by small, compact jet fans.\n- Flexible installation; positioning of the jet fans is very flexible and can be easily coordinated with other systems within the car park.\n- Optimal ventilation; because the jet fans efficiently mix the exhaust fumes with the surrounding air, high local concentrations of toxic gases are prevented.\n- No dead spots; because jet fans can be placed in parts of the car park with limited ventilation, the build-up of high local concentrations are prevented.\n- Energy savings; compared with ventilation systems with ductwork, relevant energy savings can be achieved.\n- Cost savings; during design and installation the (re-)positioning of the jet fans is very flexible.\n- Combined solution for normal ventilation and smoke ventilation in case of a fire.\n- Smoke control systems can be designed as an engineered solution, to provide clear smoke-free access for fire-fighters to a point close to the seat of the fire.\n\n![Large metal exhaust fan designed for car parks](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5856/web-1920px-jpg-q70-auz-magnelis_2.jpg?rmode=max&width=360&height=258) ![Jet fan perfect for smoke ventilation](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/6067/web-1920px-q70-azt-magnelis_1.jpg?rmode=max&width=380&height=313)\n\nOur car park solutions are very efficient, using a minimum amount of energy in all ventilation scenarios. The solution is truly 2-in-1 as they help protect lives and assets, as well as the environment.\n\nFor more detailed information on this solution, use the read more link below.\n\n### [Read more...](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/car-park-system-description/)\n\n<!-- Downloads Section -->\n### Downloads\n\n**Brochures:**\n- [Car Park Ventilation System - GB](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/4embozfb/car-park-brochure-gb-mu16232-0724.pdf)\n- [Car Park Ventilation System - D](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/bs4kj3ah/car-park-brochure-d-mu16234-0724.pdf)\n- [Car Park Ventilation System - NL](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/3rkkk5ln/car-park-brochure-nl-mu16233-0724.pdf)\n- [Car Park Ventilation System - DK](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/jfkkw3ic/car-park-brochure-dk-mu16235-0724.pdf)\n\n**Cases:**\n- [Craft Zone, Madinaty](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5906/craft-zone-madinaty-gb-mu-16078-0621.pdf)\n- [Control System upgrade](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5867/control-system-upgrade-gb-15953-0521.pdf)\n- [BLOX](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1775/blox-mu-15785-0618-gb.pdf)\n- [BMW Welt](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1149/bmw-welt-mu-15638-1017-gb.pdf)\n- [Westgate Oxford](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1151/westgate-oxford-mu-15562-1117-gb.pdf)\n- [Chirec Hospital](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1157/chirec-hospital-mu-15596-0817-gb.pdf)\n- [Axel Towers](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1158/axel-towers-mu15587-0617-gb.pdf)\n- [Esplanade](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1160/esplanade-66-37-27-mu15484-0417-gb.pdf)\n- [International Finance Centre](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1162/international-finance-centre-ifc-1-mu15497-0317-gb.pdf)\n- [Nieuw Hoog Catharijne](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1164/nieuw-hoog-catharijne-mu15494-0317-gb.pdf)\n- [Greenwich Wharf](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1165/greenwich-wharf-mu15498-0317-gb.pdf)\n- [Kvaesthus](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1216/kvaesthus-mu-15495-0317-gb.pdf)\n- [Al Rashid Mall](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1171/al-rashid-mall-mu-15504-0317-gb.pdf)\n- [Burj Khalifa](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1172/burj-khalifa-mu-15503-0317-gb.pdf)\n\n**Flyers:**\n- [Life Safety - GB](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5789/life-safety-flyer-mu-16089-gb-0321.pdf)\n\n**Reference lists:**\n- [Reference list Car Park Ventilation - GB](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/i0uju51z/reference-list-car-park-ventilation-worldwide-gb-mu-15694-0725b.pdf)\n\n**System description:**\n- [Car Park System Description - GB](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1670/car-park-system-description-gb-mu-15672-0118.pdf)\n- [Car Park System Description - D](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/4331/parkgaragen-systembeschreibung-d-mu153512-0317.pdf)\n\n**Technical papers:**\n- [Jet Fan Systems In Sprinklered Car Parks](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/6226/20121120_novenco_jet-fan_systems_in_sprinklered_car_parks.pdf)\n\n## Related Products\n\n- [Jet Fans AUZ-ARP](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/car-park-fans/jet-fans-auz-arp/)\n- [Jet Fans AUT-ART](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/car-park-fans/jet-fans-aut-art/)\n- [Jet Fans AUO-ARO](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/car-park-fans/jet-fans-auo-aro/)\n- [Jet Fans AZT](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/car-park-fans/jet-fans-azt/)\n- [Jet Fans CGF](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/car-park-fans/jet-fans-cgf/)\n- [Smoke Fans ZerAx AZN](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/smoke-fans/smoke-fans-zerax-azn/)\n- [Smoke Fans ZerAx AZL](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/smoke-fans/smoke-fans-zerax-azl/)\n- [Smoke Fans NovAx ACN](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/smoke-fans/smoke-fans-novax-acn/)\n- [Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZN-AZW](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-zerax-azn-azw/)\n- [Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZL](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-zerax-azl/)\n- [Axial Flow Fans NovAx ACN-ACW](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-novax-acn-acw/)\n- [Silencers](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/fan-accessories/silencers/)\n\n## Related Solutions\n\n- [Pressure differential systems](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/pressure-differential-systems/)\n- [Buildings](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/buildings/)\n- [Smoke control](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/smoke-control/)\n- [Tunnel ventilation](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/tunnel-ventilation/)"

The solutions are innovative and meet the demands for low energy consumption and modest running costs while securing comfortable and healthy indoor climates. The geographical distribution of NOVENCO installations spans the whole world for all kinds of buildings and industries, for example within sectors such as commercial, industrial, public and residential.\n\n### Sustainable Building Certification\n\nNOVENCO highly efficient and energy-saving ZerAx\u00ae fans contribute positively to DGNB certification of building and can have a positive impact on the points, which may account for up to 39.1% of the total certification. It is not NOVENCO's products alone that ensure the 39.1% of the percentage points, but the percentages describe the criteria by which NOVENCO's products can contribute positively to the point allocation in a particular project. The DGNB scheme gives the construction industry a common groundwork for sustainable building. The criteria in the scheme follows a fixed point score. In this way, it is possible to calculate how different decisions and choice of materials before and during the construction process impact on the final certification. More details [**Sustainable Building Certifications**](https://www.novenco-building.com/about/dgnb/)\n\n### The most efficient AHUs for comfortable indoor climates\n\nAir quality and indoor climates are just as important in residential as in commercial and industrial buildings. Ventilation and ventilation systems play key roles to maintain healthy and comfortable conditions in these types of buildings. One of the biggest challenges is to keep the indoor air quality at comfortable levels with as low an energy consumption as possible.\n\nAt the centre of most ventilation systems are the air handling units (AHUs). As a minimum, an AHU includes a fan in each air duct to move the air through the unit. Our environmentally friendly EC+ concept was developed and is kept up-to-date in close cooperation between Danfoss and NOVENCO. It is the latest response to the markets' growing demand for energy saving and needs to reduce CO\u2082 emissions. The most efficient of EC+ system solutions for AHUs are miles ahead of the competition with unmatched total system efficiencies of 85%. The EC+ concept, that is specifically conceived to increase the efficiencies of HVAC systems, comprises the NOVENCO ZerAx\u00ae series of high efficiency axial flow fans, high efficiency IE4 or IE5 permanent magnet (PM) motors and intelligent and high efficiency Danfoss VLT\u00ae frequency drives.\n\n![Diagram illustrating the EC+ efficiency equation, highlighting key variables and their relationships](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5979/ecplus-equation.jpg?rmode=max&width=712&height=346)\n\n### New levels of fan performance\n\nHigh performance NOVENCO ZerAx\u00ae axial fans have unmatched fan efficiencies of up to 92%. These efficiencies push AHU designs to new levels, and thus lower the overall power consumption as well as the sound levels for better comfort. The fan lifetimes are 20+ years, which contribute to sustainability and guarantee low maintenance costs. The ZerAx\u00ae fans are the most energy-efficient on the market today.\n\n![NOVENCO ZerAx\u00ae AHU fan](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5798/web-1920pf-q70-azn-magnelis_1.jpg?rmode=max&width=343&height=263) ![NOVENCO ZerAx\u00ae exhaust fan](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5807/web-1920pf-q70-azl-magnelis_1.jpg?rmode=max&width=352&height=263)\n\n### The highest system efficiencies and compact AHU system designs\n\nWith motor and frequency drive efficiencies both reaching above 95%, the ZerAx\u00ae fan efficiency of 92% brings the overall system efficiency to an impressing 85%. This is 20-25 percentage points better than the closest alternative solutions, such as direct-driven centrifugal plug fans with EC motors. It is the highest possible total system efficiency for AHUs available on the market. Because of the high efficiencies of the ZerAx\u00ae, it is possible to design AHUs up to 30% shorter and 30% lighter, still have the same performance characteristics and to cut expenditures on running cost. The ZerAx\u00ae fans for AHUs are complete plug-and-play solutions, that ensure easy and fast installation. Even with the improved characteristics the fan noise levels are significantly lower than those from other fan manufacturers. The fan lifetimes are 20+ years, which contribute to sustainability and guarantee low maintenance costs.\n\n![ZerAx\u00ae fan, designed for efficient cooling in commercial spaces](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5776/06_ahu-86.png?rmode=max&width=564)\n\n### [**Read more about the EC+ concept here**](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/ecplus-concept/)\n\n## Related Products\n\n- [Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZL](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-zerax-azl/)\n- [Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZN-AZW](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-zerax-azn-azw/)\n- [Axial Flow Fans NovAx ACN-ACW](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-novax-acn-acw/)\n\n## Related Solutions\n\n- [EC+ concept](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/ecplus-concept/)\n- [AHU fans](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/ahu-fans/)\n- [Pressure differential systems](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/pressure-differential-systems/)\n- [Car parks](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/car-parks/)\n- [Smoke control](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/smoke-control/)"

The search for more efficient solutions in the field of data centres cooling has long time since become a constant challenge.\n\nThe cooling energy consumption can take up to 50% of the total consumption of data centre facilities due to inefficient cooling systems. Reductions in cooling system use mean drastic reductions in data centre power consumption and services, which lower the energy and maintenance costs for facility owners, and thereby ensure long life of servers and other equipment.\n\nThe NOVENCO ZerAx\u00ae axial flow fans match the requirements for efficient cooling perfectly as they are true next generation energy-savers with efficiencies up to 92%, low sound levels and product lifetimes of 20+ years.\n\n![Data Centre Cooling Ventilation fans](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1088/data-centres.jpg?rmode=max&width=564)\n\n### NOVENCO data centre solutions\n\nWith all in-house processes covering design, research, development and manufacturing, NOVENCO Building & Industry has the ability to meet each application.

With ZerAx\u00ae product lifetimes of 20+ years, efficiencies up to 92% and low sound levels, the NOVENCO's solutions for data centres are probably the world's most profitable and quietest solutions.\n\n![Cooling and ventilation fans in a data centre](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/4305/facebook-1.jpg?rmode=max&width=564)\n\n### NOVENCO'S ZerAx\u00ae fans\n\nNOVENCO Building & Industry has a wide range of ZerAx\u00ae axial flow fans for use in different applications within a data centre.\n\nOur fans are world leading when it comes to durability, efficiency and sound levels. The Total Cost of Ownerships (TCO) of 20+ years, unmatched fan efficiencies up to 92% and low sound levels, makes NOVENCO's fans probably the most profitable and the quietest in the world. The long lifetimes and the high performance of our fans secure long maintenance intervals and low service cost.\n\n![NOVENCO'S ZerAx\u00ae fans in a data center](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/4306/facebook-4.jpg?rmode=max&width=564)\n\n### Optimise the advantage of convenience climate condition\n\nThe quality of the air that cools data halls and centres is among the most important parameters to consider in the design of these massive structures. A well thought-over regional location to facilitate free cooling calls for equally well worked out specifications to achieve precise control of temperature, humidity and airflow, which is crucial for the operability and economy of the centres. Sensitive and huge amounts of servers that operate even just a fraction off the optimum can quickly suffer and advance planned replacement.\n\n### ZerAx\u00ae is the answer\n\nThe ventilation and efficiency aspirations of even the best constructions and the most leak-proof designs cannot be better than the key components that drive the systems \u2013 the fans. Good, reliable and efficient fans make all the difference and together with the high requirements for controllable air quality, the field of suitable fans quickly narrows in. The NOVENCO ZerAx\u00ae axial flow fans with energy-efficient EC+ motors are such suitable fans and have since the introduction in 2009 been far ahead of the competition. A lead that, with fan efficiencies up to 92%, still holds.\n\nThe design and performance of the ZerAx\u00ae is efficient in every detail and gives designers and constructors optimal freedom. The form factor of the fans makes them suitable as free-blowing or as duct fans. The low total cost of ownership or TCO of employing ZerAx\u00ae fans is world-leading with top-of-class fan efficiencies, low sound levels and lifetimes of 20+ years.\n\n![NOVENCO ZerAx\u00ae ventilation system](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/4307/facebook-6.jpg?rmode=max&width=564)\n\n### NOVENCO strong references\n\nThe ZerAx\u00ae fans are already installed in the biggest data centres in the Europe and the USA where they keep servers cool, save energy and protect the environment.\n\n<!-- Downloads Section -->\n### Downloads\n\n**Brochures:**\n- [NOVENCO Data Centers GB Mu 16280 0925](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/fezdiozd/novenco-data-centers-gb-mu-16280-0925.pdf)\n\n**Cases:**\n- [Data Center, Northern Scandinavia](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1176/data-center-mu-15499-0317-gb.pdf)\n\n## Related Products\n\n- [Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZL](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-zerax-azl/)\n- [Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZL-AZN Standard Ranges](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-zerax-azl-azn-standard-ranges/)\n- [Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZN-AZW](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-zerax-azn-azw/)\n- [Acoustic diffusers](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/fan-accessories/acoustic-diffusers/)\n- [Silencers](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/fan-accessories/silencers/)\n\n## Related Solutions\n\n- [Cooling](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/cooling/)\n- [EC+ concept](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/ecplus-concept/)\n- [Retrofits](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/retrofits/)"

This is due to the unmatched EC+ total system efficiencies of up to 85%. The EC+ concept is specifically conceived to increase the efficiencies of HVAC systems and comprises the NOVENCO ZerAx\u00ae series of high-efficiency axial fans, high-efficiency IE4 and IE5 permanent magnet (PM) motors and the intelligent and high-efficiency Danfoss VLT\u00ae frequency drives.\n\n### ENERGY SAVINGS WITH ZERAX\u00ae AND EC+\n\u2022 AT LEAST 20% COMPARED TO BEST-IN-CLASS EC FANS\n\u2022 TYPICALLY, 40% BY RETROFIT OF OLD PLUG FANS\n\u2022 TYPICALLY, 50% BY RETROFIT OF OLD CENTRIFUGAL FANS\n\n![NOVENCO ZerAx\u00ae high-efficiency axial fan](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5776/06_ahu-86.png?rmode=max&width=564)\n\n![Illustration of AHU with plug fan and ZerAx axial fan](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/4162/ahu.jpg?rmode=max&width=564)\n\n### EC+ system efficiency and compact AHU system design\n\nIn optimum configurations the motor and frequency drive efficiencies can reach above 95%, which together with the ZerAx fan efficiency of 92% brings the overall system efficiency to an impressing 85%. This is 20-25 percentage points better than alternative solutions, such as direct-driven centrifugal plug fans with EC motors. It is currently the highest possible total system efficiency for AHUs on the market. Because of the high efficiencies of the ZerAx, it is possible to design AHUs up to 30% shorter and 30% lighter and still have the same performance characteristics and hence cut expenditures. The ZerAx fans for AHUs are complete plug-and-play solutions to ensure easy and fast installation. The fan noise levels are notably and significantly lower than those from other fan manufacturers. The fan lifetimes are 20+ years, which contribute to sustainability and guarantee low maintenance costs.\n\n![The EC+ efficiency equation](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5979/ecplus-equation.jpg?rmode=max&width=683&height=332)\n\n### Fast and easy EC+ upgrades\n\nNon-EC+ fans installed in HVAC systems represent up to 60% of the total energy consumption. NOVENCO's complete plug-and-play solutions guarantee easy and fast retrofit of existing installations without unnecessary replacement of whole AHUs or HVAC systems. Upgrading to EC+ solutions with ZerAx\u00ae fans radically reduces energy consumption and maintenance costs, hence increases the efficiency of the whole HVAC system. Retrofit works are often completed in less than 10 hours. The steps from upgradeable candidate to an optimised and energy-efficient EC+ AHU system are outlined below.\n\n**STEP 1 \u2013 Site study**\nIn the site study, the existing HVAC system installations are analysed and described to best understand the requirements. The study is free of charge and gives an indication of the number of achievable benefits, including potential savings and ROIs.\n\n**STEP 2 \u2013 Estimation**\nThe findings from the site study go into a detailed estimation, which summarises the potential savings in energy consumption, the carbon footprint and the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) that are achievable by, for example, retrofitting plug fans installed in existing AHUs with highly efficient ZerAx\u00ae axial fans. The estimates include an indication of the cost of the EC+ solution.\n\n**STEP 3 \u2013 Proof of concept**\nAn external and independent consulting company conducts the Proof of Concept (PoC). The feasibility is verified in an initial trial installation to confirm the estimates. It includes the following.\n- measurement and removal of the existing fans in the HVAC system\n- installation of ZerAx\u00ae axial flow fans\n- operation and measurement of the new fans\nIf the PoC cannot match the estimates, the trial is free of charge.\n\n**STEP 4 \u2013 Site upgrade**\nAfter completion of the PoC and with convincing results, a detailed plan for savings and cost of the entire retrofit-project is drawn up.

Engineering consultants require proven solutions for protecting escape routes and ensuring occupant evacuation protocols meet regulatory specifications.\n\nFire safety engineering shows that smoke inhalation causes the majority of fire-related fatalities. The toxic gas mixture contains suspended particulates and lethal chemical compounds that create immediate life-threatening conditions.\n\n![Grenfell tower fire 2017](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/4322/pds_grenfell_fire.jpg?width=500&height=282.5)\n\nWhile sprinkler systems provide compartmentalisation control, they cannot eliminate smoke exposure risks. Additional smoke control systems with dedicated pressurisation capabilities are essential for maintaining tenable conditions during evacuation.\n\nEscape route ventilation solutions include comprehensive staircase pressurisation and smoke pressurisation system designs that meet current engineering standards.\n\n## Engineering specifications for smoke control systems\n\nSmoke control systems integrate with overall fire engineering strategies for multi-storey buildings. Design coordination involves all project stakeholders to ensure compatibility with fire protection schemes and regulatory compliance.\n\nKey system requirements include:\n\n- **Performance standards** that complement fire engineering strategies\n- **Measurable safety levels** verified through testing protocols\n- **Regulatory compliance** with national and international standards\n- **Stakeholder coordination** across all design disciplines\n\nThe primary design objective maintains smoke-free conditions in designated escape routes. This can be achieved through smoke extract systems or pressure differential systems.\n\n## Technical principles of pressure differential systems\n\nAir movement follows pressure gradients from higher to lower pressure zones. Engineering design establishes controlled pressure increases in protected areas relative to fire-origin areas to prevent smoke infiltration.\n\nThe design specification establishes measured pressure gradients from protected spaces to unprotected spaces when doors remain closed. With doors open, calculated air velocities across openings prevent smoke migration into protected zones. Pressure differential systems with pressurisation fans achieve these performance parameters.\n\nNOVENCO introduces the ClearChoice\u2122 Pressure Differential Systems (PDS) as an engineered solution for creating smoke-free zones. The systems facilitate occupant evacuation from buildings and tunnels while supporting firefighting operations by preventing smoke migration.\n\nApplication specifications cover various building types and tunnel configurations where escape route protection is required:\n\n- **Stairwells and corridors** for primary evacuation routes\n- **Escape tunnels and lobbies** for secondary protection zones\n- **Firefighting access routes** for emergency response teams\n- **Building envelope penetrations** requiring smoke containment\n\nThree primary design objectives address regulatory requirements:\n\n- **Escape route protection** maintaining tenable conditions\n- **Firefighting access route protection** for emergency operations\n- **Property protection standards** preventing smoke damage\n\n### Escape route protection specifications\n\nThis represents the critical design objective where tenable environmental conditions must be maintained in protected spaces throughout anticipated occupancy evacuation periods.\n\n### Firefighting access route specifications\n\nBuilding classification determines requirements for protecting firefighting access routes and maintaining smoke-free conditions. Pressure differential systems prevent or limit smoke spread into designated firefighting routes under operational conditions.\n\n### Property protection standards\n\nThe third design objective prevents smoke migration into sensitive spaces containing equipment or materials requiring protection from smoke damage.\n\nEuropean requirements for smoke control systems are specified in EN 12101 \"Smoke and heat control systems\". Pressure differential system specifications are detailed in EN 12101 part 6. Current part 6 with PDS kits undergoes revision with part 13 addition: \"Pressure differential systems (PDS) - Design and calculation methods, installation, acceptance testing, routine testing and maintenance\".\n\n## Pressure differential system design fundamentals\n\nPressure differential systems maintain tenable conditions in protected spaces including escape routes, firefighting access routes, firefighting lift shafts, lobbies, staircases and designated smoke-free areas.\n\nThe systems create measured differential pressure between protected and unprotected spaces on fire floors to prevent smoke migration from unprotected to protected spaces.\n\nWith simultaneous door openings, the systems generate minimum air velocities across open door areas to prevent smoke entry into protected spaces. Air supply fans deliver calculated airflow rates to achieve required velocity specifications.\n\nAirflow path analysis throughout buildings encompasses fresh air supply introduction points, air and smoke exhaust locations, and circulation pathways throughout the building envelope.\n\nEssential system components include:\n\n- **Air supply and extract systems** for controlled ventilation\n- **Differential pressure control** between protected and unprotected spaces\n- **Air release pathways** for pressure relief and increased airflow\n\n<!-- Video embed placeholder -->\n<!-- Video: https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qw_L9eKbRnQ -->\n\n<!-- Video embed placeholder -->\n<!-- Video: https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O5218B92r-Q -->\n\n## EN 12101-6 system classification specifications\n\nCurrent EN 12101 part 6 defines 6 classifications for pressure differential systems based on building use specifications. Class A from EN 12101-6 applies to small buildings while complex facilities require selection from additional system classifications.\n\n### System classification matrix EN 12101-6\n\n| System class | Application specifications                                                                                                              |\n| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| A            | No evacuation unless directly threatened by fire.

A key requirement in the life safety regulations is to ensure the safe escape and evacuation of people. Most fire related deaths are caused by the inhalation of smoke and toxic gases produced by the fire and not directly by the fire itself. Therefore, the most significant threat is the highly toxic smoke, which is a lethal cocktail made up of a complex mix of suspended particles and highly toxic gases.\n\n![Grenfell tower fire 2017](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/4322/pds_grenfell_fire.jpg?width=500&height=282.5)\n\nAlthough nowadays the buildings are more frequently equipped with sprinkler systems, this alone will not ensure the occupants are not exposed to toxic smoke in case of a fire. It is evident that sprinkler systems can contribute in life safety by controlling the fire within a compartment, but in many cases the sprinkler will not extinguish the fire. Therefore, an additional smoke control system with pressuration fan function is necessary to ensure that people can find a safe way out.\n\n## Smoke control systems\n\nSmoke control systems form an element of the overall fire engineering strategy for apartment buildings and should be designed together with all the involved parties. It is the responsibility of the designer of the smoke control systems to ensure that any proposed systems compliment the fire engineering strategy and provide a suitable level of fire safety.\n\nThe main objective of these smoke control systems is to ensure safe evacuation of a building by keeping escape routes free from smoke. This can either be achieved by smoke extract systems or by pressure differential systems.\n\n## Pressure differential systems\n\nAir will naturally try to move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. By increasing the pressure in the protected areas (i.e. the escape routes) above that in the areas where the fire is likely to occur (in this case the apartments) it is possible to prevent smoke spread into these escape routes.\n\nThe aim therefore is to establish a pressure gradient from the protected space to the unprotected space (fire room) while the doors are closed. In case of doors open, a suitable air velocity should be established over the door openings to prevent the spread of smoke into the protected space. This pressure gradient can be achieved through pressure differential systems with pressurisation fans.\n\nFor this purpose NOVENCO introduces the ClearChoice\u2122 Pressure Differential Systems (PDS) as a solution for creating smoke free zones, that allow people to escape from buildings and tunnels and aid the firefighting services by preventing smoke spread through seams and cracks of physical barriers such as doors or other similar restricted openings.\n\nThe field of application differs for a variety of buildings and tunnels, where there is a need to protect means of escape such as stairwells, corridors, escape tunnels, lobbies, as well as for providing smoke free approach for the firefighting services.\n\nTo summarize, three major design objectives can be addressed:\n\n1. Protection of means of escape\n2. Protection of firefighting access routes\n3. Property protection\n\n### Protection of means of escape\n\nThis is the most important design objective of the pressurisation systems, where it is essential that tenable conditions for life safety are maintained in protected spaces for as long as they are likely to be in use by the building occupants.\n\n### Protection of firefighting routes\n\nDepending on the building classification, another design objective of the pressurisation systems is to protect firefighting access routes and keep them essentially free of smoke. In this case, the pressure differential system must be designed to prevent or at least limit the spread of smoke into the dedicated firefighting route under normal firefighting conditions.\n\n### Property protection\n\nThe third objective of the pressurisation system can be to prevent the spread of smoke from entering sensitive spaces such as those containing items that are particularly sensitive to smoke damage.\n\nIn Europe, the requirements for smoke control systems are described in the European Standard EN 12101 \"Smoke and heat control systems\". Specifications for pressure differential systems are described in EN 12101 part 6. Currently this part 6 with PDS kits is under revision and a part 13 will be added: \"Pressure differential systems (PDS) - Design and calculation methods, installation, acceptance testing, routine testing and maintenance\".\n\n## The basics of pressure differential systems\n\nPressure differential systems are designed to maintain tenable conditions in protected spaces such as, escape routes, firefighting access routes, firefighting lift shafts, lobbies, staircases and other areas that require to be kept free of smoke.\n\nThese pressure differential systems create a differential pressure between the protected space and the unprotected space of the fire floor to prevent the smoke spreading from the unprotected space to the protected space.\n\nIn case of (simultaneous) open doors, the pressure differential system must be designed to create a minimum air velocity over the area of the open doors to prevent smoke from entering the protected space. To achieve this air velocity, the air supply fan to the protected space must supply sufficient airflow over the sum of the open-door areas.\n\nAn important factor for these pressure differential systems are the airflow paths throughout the building, not only where the fresh air supply is introduced, but also where that air (and smoke) will leave the building and what paths it will follow in the process.\n\nFor a typical pressure differential system three basic components are necessary:\n\n1. air supply and air/smoke extract.\n2. differential pressure control between the protected and unprotected space.\n3. air release path for pressure relief and higher airflow with door(s) open.\n\n<!-- Video embed placeholder -->\n<!-- Video: https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qw_L9eKbRnQ -->\n\n<!-- Video embed placeholder -->\n<!-- Video: https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O5218B92r-Q -->\n\n## Pressure differential system classifications\n\nWithin the current EN 12101 part 6 there are 6 classifications for pressure differential systems based on the use of the building. For very small buildings, class A from the EN 12101-6 can be used and for more complex buildings (hotels, hospitals, nursing homes) a selection can be made from the other system classifications.\n\n### System classification EN 12101-6\n\n| System class | Examples of use |\n| ------------ | --------------- |\n| A | No evacuation unless directly threatened by fire. Unlikely that more than one door to the protected area will be open at the same time. |\n| B | **Firefighting support.** The fire brigade may be exposed to a developed fire which needs to be approached with a low smoke level. |\n| C | Immediate, simultaneous, short-term evacuation in the event of fire. Persons are expected to be alert, aware and familiar with their surroundings. |\n| D | Immediate, simultaneous, long-term evacuation in the event of fire.

The ventilation systems in facilities for growth such as these must ensure optimal conditions in the crops and promote healthy and disease-free growth. Factors like precise control of temperature, humidity, CO\u2082-content and air circulation in combination with requirements for low energy consumption and low maintenance costs put high demands on the quality and performance of the ventilation systems.\n\nNOVENCO's experience within this field of products is long and stretches more than 70 years back with design, production and delivery of custom solutions. Our fans are proven and have certified performance, that offer strength, durability and reliability in even the harshest of conditions found in these unique environments.\n\n### Ventilation of mushroom farms\n\nThe cultivation of mushrooms is a delicate process that requires perfect balances and timing from beginning to end of the many phases involved in order to have a successful outcome. The common mushroom (Latin: agaricus bisporus) needs optimal conditions and controlled growth for growers to meet market demands on time and at the lowest possible cost. The challenges this presents depends on the layout of the facility as well as the growers' individual requirements. Apart from several process fans, the ventilation system designs may include functionality like heat recovery, ammonia scrubbers, bio filters and odour treatment.\n\n![spacious greenhouse mushroom farm featuring numerous rows of mushrooms](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/4311/f7fc45-praca-sezonowa-w-belgii-zbieracze-pieczarek-poznan-zdjecia.jpg?rmode=max&width=590&height=270)\n\n### Ventilation of greenhouses\n\nCrops in greenhouses grow in equally unique environments as mushrooms in farms. The circulation of air creates even conditions for growth while at the same time also limits the risk of diseases and moisture damages. As a result, ventilation systems for greenhouses are critical as they keep cost down, increase production and ensure optimal conditions for the crops.\n\n![Sunlight streams through the roof of a greenhouse, illuminating the vibrant plants inside.](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1131/fotolia_70600080_l.jpg?rmode=max&width=585&height=390)\n\n### Choose the correct fans\n\nThe fans are the single most important component for active ventilation of greenhouses and for the movement of air within these buildings. Circulation fans are often part of passive ventilation systems in structures with minimum ventilation.\n\nThe use of fans for air exchange is a very effective approach to pull air through the full length of structures and thereby avoid hot air pockets. Extraction fans in higher locations in greenhouses are more effective for cooling than fans in lower locations.\n\nActive ventilation systems have limited capacity to quickly change large volumes of air. If the design specifications for a greenhouse are inadequate, it can result in poor air circulation through the crops. Under-ventilated structures often have overheating problems in the crop that is in the middle of, for example, greenhouses.\n\nTo ensure correct capacity and installation, select the fans in consultation with an independent expert and NOVENCO\u00ae. Ventilation fans generally must have enough capacity to completely replace the air in the greenhouse once every minute.\n\nTwo very important aspects in the choice of fans are the operational cost and noise generation. To be able to keep operational cost down can contribute considerably in the quest for satisfying economic outcomes. The control of noise may pose problems in the production facilities as well as in the areas surrounding the facilities. A good example of a fan, that more than meets these tough criteria, is the NOVENCO ZerAx\u00ae, which is the most energy-efficient in the market and with very low noise levels.\n\nThe special set of challenges found in the aggressive environments known from mushrooms farms call for especially robust fans. Well-proven fans for these purposes are our centrifugal flow fans, that are optimised for delivery of process air in composting plants and withstand corrosion caused by the moist environments.\n\n## Related Products\n\n- [Centrifugal Fans CAL](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/centrifugal-fans/centrifugal-fans-cal/)\n- [Centrifugal Fans CNA-CNB](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/centrifugal-fans/centrifugal-fans-cna-cnb/)\n- [Centrifugal Fans CND-CNF](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/centrifugal-fans/centrifugal-fans-cnd-cnf/)\n- [Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZN-AZW](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-zerax-azn-azw/)\n- [Axial Flow Fans NovAx ACN-ACW](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-novax-acn-acw/)\n- [Axial Flow Fans NovAx ACP-ACG](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-novax-acp-acg/)\n\n## Related Solutions\n\n- [Agriculture](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/agriculture/)\n- [Cooling](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/cooling/)\n- [Drying](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/drying/)\n- [Process industry](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/process-industry/)"

Livestock suffer from heat stress and respiratory issues that reduce productivity. High humidity promotes disease spread. Toxic gas accumulation threatens animal welfare and worker safety.\n\nNOVENCO Building & Industry delivers proven ventilation solutions engineered for agricultural operations. Our energy-saving systems optimise conditions in farms, dairy facilities, and livestock buildings. These solutions increase productivity while reducing health issues.\n\nEngineering ensures storage ventilation conditions that minimise waste and maximise efficiency. Equipment payback periods remain short due to reduced costs.\n\n![A group of piglets in a barn eating hay](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1132/fotolia_187293814_m.jpg?rmode=max&width=564)\n\n## Critical agricultural ventilation requirements\n\nAgricultural HVAC systems must address four essential needs:\n\n**Fresh air supply management**\nLivestock facilities require fresh air volumes to control humidity, temperature, and odours while maintaining air quality. Proper airflow prevents respiratory stress and productivity losses.\n\n**Uniform air distribution**\nEffective systems ensure consistent air speed and temperature throughout livestock areas. This prevents dead zones where animals experience poor conditions and maintains comfort.\n\n**Precise temperature control**\nLivestock productivity peaks within temperature ranges that vary by species and age. Maintaining these ranges impacts animal health, feed conversion, and reproduction rates.\n\n**Hazardous gas management**\nCarbon dioxide from livestock respiration displaces oxygen in confined spaces. Ammonia, methane and hydrogen sulphide gases accumulate from manure, creating hazardous conditions that reduce productivity and threaten worker safety.\n\n## Professional system design considerations\n\nSuccessful agricultural ventilation requires meeting regulations while addressing operational realities:\n\n- **Livestock specifications** - Requirements depend on animal type, age, and body weight\n- **Facility planning** - Current and future applications must be defined\n- **Climate adaptation** - Weather patterns significantly impact design decisions\n- **Backup systems** - Adequate supplemental heating and cooling for extreme conditions\n\n## Advanced ventilation eliminates costly ductwork\n\nAxial flow fans deliver superior performance engineered for agricultural environments. These systems achieve optimal pressures while maximising energy efficiency.\n\nNOVENCO Building & Industry produces industry-leading axial flow fans that set standards for energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness in agricultural applications. The designs withstand harsh conditions.\n\n## Maximising agricultural fan efficiency\n\nStrategic fan selection and sizing impact operational costs and livestock productivity:\n\n**Intelligent sizing approach**\n- Oversised fans waste energy and increase operating costs\n- Larger diameter fans operate more efficiently\n- Right-sizing prevents energy waste while ensuring airflow\n\n**High-performance technology**\nPerformance differences between premium and standard fans impact costs. Energy-efficient fans with integrated diffusers and cones deliver efficiency that reduces expenses while improving livestock comfort.\n\nContact us to discuss your requirements and receive guidance on optimising your system for efficiency.\n\n## Related products\n\n- [Centrifugal Fans CAL](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/centrifugal-fans/centrifugal-fans-cal/)- [Centrifugal Fans CNA-CNB](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/centrifugal-fans/centrifugal-fans-cna-cnb/)- [Centrifugal Fans CND-CNF](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/centrifugal-fans/centrifugal-fans-cnd-cnf/)- [Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZN-AZW](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-zerax-azn-azw/)- [Axial Flow Fans NovAx ACN-ACW](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-novax-acn-acw/)- [Axial Flow Fans NovAx ACP-ACG](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-novax-acp-acg/)\n\n## Related solutions\n\n- [Mushrooms and greenhouses](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/mushrooms-and-greenhouses/)- [Cooling](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/cooling/)- [Drying](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/drying/)- [Process industry](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/process-industry/)",

Our optimal energy-saving solutions and designs for farms, dairy and industrial facilities are innovative and help ensure environmentally safe ventilation and comfort. The solutions are robust and can increase productivity substantially as well as reduce health issues at low investment and operating cost. Our products and knowledge contribute to perfect storage conditions and hence, reduce losses through waste. Payback times are short due to the low running costs, the increase in productional effectiveness, less waste and high equipment durability.\n\n![A group of piglets in a barn eating hay](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1132/fotolia_187293814_m.jpg?rmode=max&width=564)\n\n### Characteristics of optimal HVAC systems for agricultural buildings\n\n- **Provision of proper fresh air at all times** - During warm months large amounts of fresh air are required to supply enough air to control humidity, temperature, odours and other parameters.\n- **Distribute fresh air evenly** - The fresh air distribution system must service all areas of the livestock space to ensure acceptable air quality in terms of air speed and temperature.\n- **Maintain a suitable temperature** - Livestock has a better productivity when the \"comfort temperature range\" is met.\n- **Control of odours and gases** - Carbon dioxide from the livestock's respiration displaces oxygen. Ammonia, methane and hydrogen sulphide gases come from manure and can easily reach unacceptable levels. Furthermore, too high concentrations of gases reduce livestock productivity and create poor working conditions for the employees. Extreme levels cause severe injuries and death.\n\n### Ventilation system design for agricultural buildings\n\nSeveral criteria must be met by the ventilation system design. It is crucial to determine and adhere to the regulations and standards. The requirements for the ventilation system design depend on the type of livestock, age and body weight, which is why it is important to define what the intended use of the facility is and to consider future uses. Local weather conditions with consideration to global warming trends in the area are also of great importance. The ventilation system must be designed with an adequate supplemental heating and cooling for extreme climatic conditions.\n\n### Fans for HVAC ventilation systems in agricultural buildings\n\nThe purpose of agricultural buildings is to provide optimal conditions for the livestock's well-being and productivity. Effective ventilation is a key requirement in this connection, where axial fans are very commonly employed. Axial fans are excellent for achievement of both static and dynamic pressures for optimal energy utilisation. The fans are as such the most efficient for use in ventilation of these kinds of buildings. NOVENCO Building & Industry produces axial flow fans, which are on the technological forefront when it comes to energy and cost-efficiency.\n\n### For optimal ventilation\n\n- **Fans should have the correct size** - Fans larger than necessary waste energy. However, large diameter fans are usually more efficient than smaller diameter fans.\n- **Energy-efficient fans should be the preferred choice** - There is a significant difference between the best and worst performing fans. Moreover, fans with diffusers or cones are more efficient than fans without.\n\n## Related Products\n\n- [Centrifugal Fans CAL](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/centrifugal-fans/centrifugal-fans-cal/)\n- [Centrifugal Fans CNA-CNB](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/centrifugal-fans/centrifugal-fans-cna-cnb/)\n- [Centrifugal Fans CND-CNF](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/centrifugal-fans/centrifugal-fans-cnd-cnf/)\n- [Axial Flow Fans ZerAx AZN-AZW](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-zerax-azn-azw/)\n- [Axial Flow Fans NovAx ACN-ACW](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-novax-acn-acw/)\n- [Axial Flow Fans NovAx ACP-ACG](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/axial-flow-fans-novax-acp-acg/)\n\n## Related Solutions\n\n- [Mushrooms and greenhouses](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/mushrooms-and-greenhouses/)\n- [Cooling](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/cooling/)\n- [Drying](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/drying/)\n- [Process industry](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/process-industry/)"

Their freezer plants are located all over the country and from their most southern location in Padborg they ship 250-300 tons of food a day. That amounts to a total of 200,000 pallets per year. Part of the business is freezing fresh meat at minus 30 \u00b0C and storing it at minus 18 \u00b0C until it is shipped out into the world in freezer trucks and containers.\n\nThe company freezes up to 1,800 tons a day so naturally a large amount of energy is required to keep the plant going and to meet the customers' demands.\n\nCS Gruppen A/S is even expanding their capacity in Padborg to expedite even greater quantities and accommodate the technological and environmental requirements of a modern freezer facility. When reviewing the plant for energy optimisation the existing fans were included in the review. The 25-30 year old fans represented a large part of the energy consumption in the freezing tower.\n\n### THE SOLUTION\n\nThe freezing of fresh meat occurs under extreme cold conditions with high requirements for quality and reliability of equipment. After a thorough dialogue with three different suppliers, each offering very different solutions, the decision was made to install the ZerAx\u00ae [axial flow fans](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/) at the plant. This solution had the highest acquisition value, but calculations showed that the ROI would only be 23 months. This is due to the ZerAx\u00ae fan efficiency of up to 90%. The ROI calculations are based on the plant running at full capacity (5,000 hours per year). A reduction of the operation time will prolong the ROI.\n\n### EQUIPMENT DELIVERY\n\nThe freezing tunnel is in four sections each with an air volume of 100,000 m\u00b3/h. The design is for fast freezing of meat, which is placed on gratings in layers where air circulates in the spaces between to facilitate quick freezing. The tunnel has four ZerAx\u00ae fans type AZL-900 each with an airflow capacity of 25,000 m\u00b3/h.\n\nThe ZerAx\u00ae AZL-900 has an efficiency of 90% and is delivered with highly efficient IE3 motors designed for temperatures down to -30 \u00b0C, short diffuser on the outlet and silicone thermo cable for frost protection of the fan casing.\n\n### [View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1170/cs-gruppen-mu15501-0317-gb.pdf)"

Especially the automotive industry faces challenges to reduce major environmental contributions from the production lines and improve sustainability. An important and often critical area is in the need for efficient HVAC solutions, where future requirements grow rapidly and makes the green technology race spiral with implementation of continuously greener solutions.\n\n### SPORTY DYNAMICS MEETS CUTTING-EDGE FAN AND AHU TECHNOLOGIES\n\nAmong the manufacturers that already now addresses the climate goals at the end of the decade is a world famous German manufacturer of sports cars. Apart from the production of cars with sporty dynamics and of which many have become iconic, this manufacturer has upgraded the air-conditioning systems in the paint-spray lines with the latest and very efficient AHU technology.\nThe top-modern and environmentally friendly paint-spray lines now benefit from the most economical and durable technology for AHUs on the market, which incorporates the extremely efficient NOVENCO\u00ae ZerAx\u00ae fans. Just as the aerodynamics of the sport cars ensure smooth and uncomplicated airflows, so do the ZerAx axial fans in the AHUs. The single airflow axial fans are completely unlike [centrifugal fans](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/centrifugal-fans/), where the dynamic pressure is lost due to the design. The ZerAx does not throw anything away, as it keeps both the static and dynamic pressures, which result in huge and obvious energy advantages.\n\nSustainability is one the German sports cars manufacturer's prime goals and with use of ZerAx fans they surpass the eco-design requirements set forth in the EU directive 2009/125/EC.\nIn addition, the AHUs with ZerAx fans, in comparison to AHUs with centrifugal fans, reduce investments, save materials, require less space and generally boost comfort levels with low noise and sound.\n\n### THE ZERAX\u00ae FAN \u2013 A GAME CHANGER WITH 92% FAN EFFICIENCY\n\nThe highly efficient ZerAx\u00ae axial fans are in fact best in class and are well above the environmental legislative requirements of today in terms of energy consumption, sustainability and reusability. As such they are well-suited for much stricter future requirements.\nIn this installation, the market-leading fan efficiency of 92% ensures that almost all the aerodynamic energy is preserved and results in the equally impressive system efficiency of 81%.\nQuite ingeniously the NOVENCO engineers contribute to short AHU lengths with dual functionality as part of the fan design. The diffusers simply double as silencers and convert the airflow velocity into static pressure, while also reducing the sound levels.\n\n### [View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5752/porsche-mu-16062-0221-gb.pdf)"

The old system from 2012 consisted of seven large axial fans, each with an air volume of 240,000 m\u00b3/h. The fans were driven by 160 kW motors on the inlet side by means of separately mounted intermediate shafts. In case of failures, the customer had considerable difficulties with repairs, replacement was simply not possible due to the size. The result was long downtimes. The maintenance effort was enormous due to the system design and the many wear parts.\n\n### FAN ARRAYS IN MODULAR DESIGN\n\nThe system was replaced with modular NOVENCO fan arrays originally developed for large data centre projects. Special double-diffusers made for the existing interfaces, made it possible to make the dynamic pressure available to the system. State-of-the-art motors and highly efficient converter control has meant that system efficiencies above 80% are achieved.\n\nThe modular fan arrays allow for quick fan replacement through use of compact electric pallet trucks in a plug-and-play process. The modular design and low weight thereof made it possible to use existing installation routes via doors and lifts, which made the installation simple and effective.\n\nIn the event of a fan failure, it is possible to prevent backflow by means of a plug-in disc on the outlet side of the fan, which provides almost 90% redundancy.\n\nA total of 28 NOVENCO\u00ae ZerAx\u00ae AZL900 axial fans were installed, each with an air volume of 60,000 m\u00b3/h (@ 1,600 Pa). With a total air volume of 1.68 million m\u00b3/h and an energy saving in the operation of more than 50%, among other things due to the implementation of intelligent demand-responsive control, annual energy savings of 4.9 million kWh are achieved.\n\n### [View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/6134/foundry-hall-ventilation-gb-mu-16168-0522.pdf)\n"

This is neither economical nor environmentally friendly in view of the enormous challenges posed by the climate protection targets. With modern fans, the total pressure and thus the total energy of the air-flow is utilized. As a result, system efficiencies of up to 85% are achievable.\nNOVENCO Building & Industry is your partner in achievement of your climate protection goals at a reasonable cost.\n\n## SUMMARY\n\nThe use of the ZerAx\u00ae fan with state-of-the-art components in combination with advanced system concepts proves the huge potential for reduction of the ecological footprint in ventilation systems. In the Frankfurt Airport project, fewer kWh are consumed, fewer raw materials are used and less CO2 is emitted in comparition with the old ventilation solution. NOVENCO ZerAx axial fans, with their 92% efficiency, 98% recyclability rate and 20+ years of lifetime, are a long-term, environmentally friendly and efficient solution for a greener future.\n\n## [View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/6148/frankfurt-airport-gb-mu-16173-0622.pdf)"

Over the past few decades the mine operated to extract salt before it was closed in 1982. It has now been converted into a modern backfill mine and serves to protect the surface through filling up the cavities in the former excavation. For this purpose, more than 200,000 tons of mineral waste materials are stored every year at a depth of approx. 700 metres. By using the cavities for the environmentally friendly and long-term safe disposal of mineral waste from municipal and industrial plants, the backfill mine makes a significant and sustainable contribution to environmental protection.\n\n## IMPLEMENTING THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY\n\nFor the latest renovation project at the backfill mine, carried out to improve ventilation systems under the ground, the main contractor **Jeremias\u00ae Chimney Systems** has delivered a specially designed and 36 m tall chimney together with all steel construction and ductworks. With focus on a sustainable green solution for the project, the NOVENCO\u00ae ZerAx\u00ae axial flow fan was approved as an obvious choice for the Teutschenthal mine owners. The highly efficient and in 98% recyclable fan contributed considerably to the achievement of a state subsidy for the project. The ZerAx fan, in size \u00d82 m, is combined with an IE5 class Nidec PM motor type Dyneo+ and a Danfoss VLT frequency converter, which gives the unique configuration of the latest EC+ fan technology. This highest possible system efficiency is a green solution that goes beyond the requirements of today.\n\n## THE GREENEST WATT IS THE ONE NEVER PRODUCED\n\nHere in the Teutschenthal backfill mine, the ZerAx fan with efficiency up to 92% is combined with an IE5 class Nidec PM motor and a Danfoss VLT frequency converter. The motor power is 220 kW. In a direct comparison to traditional IE3 motors of 220 kW, the weight-saving is approx. half a ton. Also worth mentioning is that traditional 4-pole AC motors of the same physical dimensions only have a maximum power of 132 kW. The implementation of this solution proves that synchronous EC+ technology can accommodate energy performance with a reduced environmental footprint in the form of less kWh. Less kWh consumed, fewer raw materials used and lower CO\u2082 emissions. Combined with the ZerAx fan efficiency of up to 92%, 98% recyclability rate and 20+ years of lifetime this solution is of great benefit to the environment for many years to come.\n\n## [View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/6170/teutschenthal-gb-mu-16151-0622.pdf)"

The renewed Nieuw Hoog Catharijne mall in Utrecht required a comprehensive solution for one of the Netherlands' largest underground car parks.\n\nWorking in confined spaces requires modified installation techniques. Limited crane access and restricted delivery routes create complex scheduling requirements.\n\nThe construction comprises 23,000 m\u00b2 of retail space, 19,000 m\u00b2 of shopping gallery, 9,000 m\u00b2 of hotel space and an underground car park with approximately 1,300 spaces. The project includes 60 apartments above the mall complex.\n\n## Turnkey solution for 40,000 m\u00b2 car park\n\nNOVENCO\u00ae Building & Industry (NBI) delivered a complete turnkey solution including re-design, component delivery, installation and commissioning support. The 5 level underground car park spans an impressive 40,000 m\u00b2 parking area.\n\nThe installation crew faced a unique construction challenge. The car park was built simultaneously in upward and downward directions starting from level -2. This approach required careful coordination of equipment delivery and installation scheduling.\n\nEquipment access required specialised rigging methods. Material staging areas were established at key levels to minimise handling time.\n\nThe dual-purpose system handles both daily fresh air and CO/LPG ventilation while providing fire brigade smoke extraction capability when needed.\n\n## Streamlined equipment package enables rapid deployment\n\nThe installation team deployed equipment designed for quick setup:\n\n**Fresh Air Supply:**\n- Two large NovAx\u2122 ACP-1400 [axial flow fans](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/) delivering 200,000 m\u00b3/h total capacity\n- 6 pcs NovAx\u2122 AUT-400 jet fans in entrance tunnels for additional fresh air induction\n\n**Air Distribution:**\n- 42 pcs of CGF-500 centrifugal jet fans throughout parking levels\n- CGF-500 units feature low-profile design with only 27 cm installation height, maximising clearance\n\n**Exhaust System:**\n- Three large NovAx\u2122 ACN-1600 axial flow fans providing 460,000 m\u00b3/h total exhaust capacity\n\nAll jet fans received white powder coating to match the clean interior aesthetic. The white finish also simplifies maintenance and inspection procedures.\n\n## Comprehensive installation meets Dutch safety standards\n\nNBI provided comprehensive installation including roof cowls, ventilation grills across all shaft levels, and system balancing components. Through our parent company SCHAKO, we installed attenuator baffles, fan isolation dampers and large shaft dampers for precise system balancing.\n\nInstallation crews coordinated with structural and electrical contractors for proper equipment mounting. Pre-fabricated mounting brackets accelerated the installation process.\n\nCommissioning procedures included comprehensive system testing across all levels. Field adjustments optimised system balance and ensured compliance with Dutch fire safety regulations.\n\nThis project demonstrates capability to handle complex multi-level installations with unique construction methodologies.\n\n## [View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1164/nieuw-hoog-catharijne-mu15494-0317-gb.pdf)\n",

The new design aligns shopping centre and city centre, as two parallel boulevards run through the building from the Central Station to the city centre, creating one common space area. A quite attractive element of this construction - \"Stadskamer\", made of glass from the bottom to the top, allows visitors to experience the flowing canal Catharijnesingel just under their feet.\n\nThe construction comprises 23,000 m\u00b2 of retail space, 19,000 m\u00b2 of shopping gallery, 9,000 m\u00b2 of hotel space and an underground car park with approximately 1,300 spaces. Moreover, the construction will also include 60 apartments just above the Nieuw Hoog Catharijne.\n\n## FIVE STOREY UNDERGROUND\n\nNOVENCO Building & Industry (NBI) was awarded the contract for the re-design, component delivery, installation and assisted on the commissioning of the car park ventilation system for this unique 5 level underground car park. With an impressive 40,000 m\u00b2 parking area, this is one of the largest underground car parks in The Netherlands. Furthermore, an unusual and very interesting building method was chosen for the car park. To advance and speed up the whole process, it was built in upward and downward directions concomitantly starting from level -2.\n\nAlthough the car park ventilation system is mainly designed as a fresh air and CO/LPG ventilation solution, the system can also be used by the fire brigade as a smoke ventilation system in case of fires.\n\n## EQUIPMENT DELIVERY\n\nTo create an efficient ventilation system, NBI supplied two large NovAx ACP-1400 [axial flow fans](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/) with a total fresh air capacity of approx. 200,000 m\u00b3/h. Further fresh air is supplied through the huge entrance tunnels, which are equipped with in total 6 pcs NovAx AUT-400 jet fans which induce further fresh air into the car park facility. The fresh air is distributed throughout the parking levels by means of 42 pcs of CGF-500 centrifugal jet fans. The CGF-500 jet fans have an installation height of less than 27 cm, ensuring maximum available clearance height in the car park levels. Three large NovAx ACN-1600 axial flow fans, with a total exhaust capacity of 460,000 m\u00b3/h, ensure that the polluted air mixture is safely extracted from the car park. All jet fans were powder coated in the colour white. In combination with the white ceiling and walls, the car park looks and feels really clean and fresh.\n\nNBI also installed large roof cowls on top of the ventilation shafts and ventilation grills on all levels of the ventilation shafts. Through the parent company SCHAKO, NBI also supplied and installed attenuator baffles, fan isolation dampers and large dampers for the ventilation shafts to balance the ventilation system throughout all parking levels.\n\n## [View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1164/nieuw-hoog-catharijne-mu15494-0317-gb.pdf)"

Meeting variable occupancy loads whilst maintaining acoustic standards presented engineering challenges requiring advanced control strategies.\n\n## Fixed-speed systems waste energy continuously\n\nLegacy ventilation systems consumed excessive energy. The original building's 12 ventilation systems operated at full capacity during events, renewing 150,000 cubic metres of air per hour. Fixed-speed motors ran continuously regardless of actual demand.\n\nBinary control limitations created operational inefficiencies:\n\n- **Constant full-speed operation** during all events\n- **Identical power consumption** whether serving 400 or 1,600 occupants\n- **No modulation capability** for partial loads\n- **Excessive air changes** during lower occupancy periods\n\nThis inflexible operation pattern generated substantial energy waste and CO2 emissions throughout the facility's operational history. Heat recovery systems could not compensate for the fundamental inefficiency of fixed-speed control.\n\n## Variable speed drives match real-time demand\n\nClimaster ZerAx\u00ae systems replaced the legacy equipment in summer 2011. NOVENCO Building & Industry delivered 12 air handling units as part of a comprehensive energy retrofit project.\n\nZerAx\u00ae fan technology delivers energy-efficient ventilation through advanced motor control and sensor integration. Variable speed capability enables proportional airflow adjustment matching real-time occupancy levels.\n\nKey system features include:\n\n- **Variable frequency drives** for continuous speed modulation\n- **Air quality sensors** monitoring CO2 concentration\n- **Heat recovery rotors** capturing thermal energy\n- **Demand-based control** responding to actual ventilation requirements\n\nIntegration with building management systems allows centralised monitoring and optimisation across all 12 ventilation systems.\n\n## High-efficiency impellers exceed 90% performance\n\nEnergy efficiency improvements maintain equivalent airflow capacity whilst reducing operational costs. Air quality sensors enable demand-based ventilation, adjusting supply to actual occupancy rather than design maximum.\n\nZerAx\u00ae technology incorporates high-efficiency impellers with rates exceeding 90%. Frequency control optimises motor performance across the operational envelope. Electronically commutated motors deliver superior part-load efficiency compared to conventional induction motors.\n\nAdvanced impeller aerodynamics reduce pressure losses whilst maintaining airflow characteristics. Backward-curved blades generate stable performance curves across the speed range.\n\n## Documented savings reduce costs 67,000 EUR annually\n\nThe installation delivers quantified performance improvements across multiple metrics:\n\n- 50% LOWER ENERGY CONSUMPTION PER FAN\n- 50% REDUCED ENERGY CONSUMPTION ON ALL UNITS COMBINED\n- 170 TONS REDUCED CO2 EMISSION PER YEAR\n- SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED SOUND LEVEL\n- Annual savings exceed 67,000 EUR\n\nThese documented outcomes demonstrate the technical and economic advantages of modern ventilation system upgrades in large public facilities. Variable speed operation achieves energy reductions through cube-law relationships between fan speed and power consumption.\n\nAcoustic performance improvements result from reduced rotational speeds during partial load conditions. Lower tip speeds generate less aerodynamic noise whilst maintaining adequate airflow for occupant comfort and air quality standards.\n\n### [View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1179/aarhus-musikhus-mu-15489-0317-gb.pdf)\n",

The completed building occupies more than 33,000 m\u00b2 and has 500 rooms. It is visited annually by 700,000 people and provides a venue for more than 1,000 events a year.\n\n### THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION MUST BE REDUCED\n\nThe Aarhus Concert Hall saves more than 67,000 EUR in energy expenses and 170 ton CO2 annually with Climaster ZerAx\u00ae. NOVENCO Building & Industry has delivered more than 12 air handling units for The Aarhus Concert Hall during the summer of 2011. The delivery was part of a comprehensive energy retrofit of the concert hall, and for this project NOVENCO Building & Industry designed the Climaster ZerAx\u00ae.\n\nThe ZerAx\u00ae fan is an important corner stone in considerably reducing the energy consumption compared to similar products.\n\n### MINIMUM ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND INDOOR CLIMATE\n\nThe energy improvement on a grand scale happens with the replacement of the ventilation unit, or rather 12 [ventilation systems](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/smoke-control/) - in the original building. Since its inauguration in 1982, the ventilation system ran at full capacity each time an event took place on stage. When the ventilation was used in the halls in the original building, it renewed 150,000 cubic metres of air per hour. In the Grand Hall this meant that the air was renewed six times per hour. The old units had two settings - on or off. That meant that they used the same amount of power, regardless of whether there were 400 or nearly 1,600 people in the hall.\n\nThrough the years this has cost a lot of energy - to pump fresh and unused air in and out of the hall. With the new ventilation system the energy wastage has come to an end, since it has speed regulators for the motors, an air quality gauge and a rotor transmission.\n\n### THERE ARE SEVERAL ADVANTAGES\n\nThe new ventilation equipment in the original part of the Concert Hall is capable of circulating and renewing just as many cubic metres of air as the old equipment. In some areas there will be significant improvements, both on the audience experience and on the Concert Hall's climate account.\n\nThe system is equipped with a sensor and frequency control, based on Climaster ZerAx\u00ae, containing the Novenco Building & Industry highly effective fan with a rate exceeding 90%.\n\nThe air quality in the hall is checked constantly so the unit can replace the air as necessary. Therefore it provides for optimum air quality, regardless if the hall is full or half full. At the same time, the air measurements ensure that fresh, unused air and expensive energy is not squandered.\n\n### FACTS\n\n- 50% LOWER ENERGY CONSUMPTION PER FAN\n- 50% REDUCED ENERGY CONSUMPTION ON ALL UNITS COMBINED\n- 170 TONS REDUCED CO2 EMISSION PER YEAR\n- SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED SOUND LEVEL\n\n### [View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1179/aarhus-musikhus-mu-15489-0317-gb.pdf)"

With heights of 120 and 100 metres, these two towers will make a visible contribution to The Hague's skyline. Upon completion in 2022, the two towers will include 655 high-quality flats, cafes, restaurants and an underground, enclosed car park with space for 245 passenger cars.\n\nNOVENCO Building & Industry was selected to design, supply, install and commission the certified pressurization systems and the [car park ventilation](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/car-parks/) system. High standards are set for the sustainability in the project, which are much in line with NOVENCO's corporate sustainability objectives. \"This is not only reflected in the products, but also in the production methods and the 98% product recyclability. At Grotius we will use the most energy-efficient fan of its kind in the world,\" explains Ruud van Beek, Director at NOVENCO in The Netherlands.\n\n## CLEAR CHOICE LIFE SAFETY SYSTEMS\n\nIn the event of a fire in the residential towers, the NOVENCO Clear Choice pressurization systems ensure that the stairwells remain free of smoke. In order to give the occupants sufficient time to escape, many factors must be taken into consideration for the pressurization systems, such as doors that are opened or closed and the height of the buildings.\n\nProduct Manager at NOVENCO, Toine van der Wielen explains: \"When the doors are closed, a pressure difference of 50 Pascal must be maintained. If a door is opened on the fire floor, an air velocity must be created across the door opening from the pressurised space to the floor. The transition from pressure to air velocity and vice versa has to be very quick in order to prevent smoke from flowing into the stairwell. We are able to achieve this within three seconds.\"\n\n## EQUIPMENT DELIVERY\n\nThe Clear Choice pressurization systems are designed using Revit 3D BIM and include 2 pcs. NovAx\u2122 axial pressurization fans and 4 pcs. ZerAx\u00ae certified axial smoke fans. The complete ZerAx\u00ae fan range is certified for variable speed operation during smoke extract. Pressure relief dampers are installed in each of the 6 shafts to guarantee system functionality. The control system comprises several control panels in combination with 70 Clear Choice Interface Boxes (CCIB) to control and monitor the \u00b1 220 certified smoke control dampers and \u00b1 210 pressure sensors. In order to guarantee a smoke-free air intake, 8 shut-off dampers with smoke detectors and weather grilles are installed.\n\nFor the two-level underground car park, NOVENCO's jet fan-based ventilation system will be installed to ensure fresh and healthy air throughout the car park.

The 18-storey Keppel Bay Tower, owned and operated by Keppel Land, has been certified as a Green Mark Platinum (Zero Energy) building by the Building and Construction Authority (BCA), which makes it the first commercial building in Singapore to achieve this distinction.\n\n## TOP 5 TECHNOLOGIES\n\nThe transformation began in 2018, when the Building and Construction Authority (BCA), a part of the Ministry of National Development of the Singapore Government, awarded Keppel Land with a grant of over $1 million under the Green Buildings Innovation Cluster (GBIC) programme to implement new and emerging energy-efficient technologies at Keppel Bay Tower. The tower had already achieved the Singapore Green Mark Platinum status and the aim of the GBIC initiative was to reduce the energy consumption by a further 20%. Over 50 applicants applied to take part in the GBIC competition. Out of them, the BCA chose 5 technology partners for the trial at the tower. NOVENCO Building & Industry's proposal to retrofit an existing centrifugal fan in an air handling unit with a high efficiency ZerAx\u00ae axial fan was chosen due to the significant energy reduction potential indicated by probing measurements and verification techniques. The ease of the retrofit work was a further contributing factor for choosing the up-to-date and the most efficient fan in the world, the NOVENCO\u00ae ZerAx\u00ae fan.\n\n## RETROFIT IN LESS THAN 10 HOURS\n\nThe energy-efficient technologies implemented at Keppel Bay Tower include the most modern technologies such as the innovative and highly efficient EC+ concept of NOVENCO\u00ae ZerAx\u00ae axial fans with high efficiency motors and Danfoss VFD\u00aes. The retrofit work went smoothly and was completed in an impressive time of less than 10 hours. The energy savings of 43% achieved through use of the ZerAx EC+ fans have been verified by the independent adjudicators Nanyang Technological University (NTU). The impact the ZerAx EC+ fans have on the annual energy consumption of the building resulted in February 2020 in a 22.3% reduction, which exceeded the initial target of 20%.

With the group-wide future program \"Strategy 2025\", Volkswagen wants to get fit for the future with the vision of becoming a world-leading provider of sustainable mobility. Sustainable means also responsible care for the environment.\n\nSustainable growth is the basis of medium-term future planning and the associated increase in value and image of any company. In that context, the new generation of air handling units with [axial fans](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/) can contribute greatly in all areas of ventilation and air conditioning.\n\nSince the beginning of 2017, Volkswagen has been intensively investigating the technical possibilities of high-efficiency axial fans and has carried out a whole series of tests, measurements and practical trials. At the beginning of 2018, it was time for the next step: implementation of the obtained results and knowledge in new air conditioning technology. Two production sites in two countries had air handling units with new technology and highly efficient axial fans installed \u2013 at Porsche in Stuttgart/Zuffenhausen, Germany and at Volkswagen Navarra in Pamplona, Spain.\n\n## PROJECT FACTS\n\n- AHU MANUFACTURER: TRUBEL KLIMATECHNIK\n- INSTALLATION LOCATION: PAMPLONA, SPAIN\n- NUMBERS: 3 AHUs WITH 80,000 m\u00b3/h EACH and 3 AHUs WITH 60,000 m\u00b3/h EACH\n- TOTAL CAPACITY: 420,000 m\u00b3/h\n\n## VOLKSWAGEN NAVARRA, PIONEER AND ROLE MODEL FOR THE USE OF SUSTAINABLE VENTILATION TECHNOLOGY\n\nVolkswagen Navarra assumes daily responsibility for the environment, safety and society. Thereby resource management and emissions receive special attention. Through innovation and impressive planning at the site, the goal is to continuously reduce energy consumption and the associated CO2 emissions. For this strategic interest, the new device technology with the new ZerAx\u00ae axial fans was deliberately chosen as a solution for the renewal of the ventilation in the assembly hall.\n\n*\"The demands placed on the air conditioning of buildings increase steadily. Axial fans can make a significant contribution to combining technical requirements with sustainable building design. The new trend-setting AHU technology has fully met all expectations.\"*\n\n**Asier Matorell, Factory Planning Manager, Volkswagen Navarra and Axel Rossmannek, Head of Supply Planning Volkswagen Wolfsburg**\n\n## THE VOLKSWAGEN PROJECT\n\nThe ventilation had to be completely renewed for one of the largest production buildings of the factory. Higher air volumes were needed and the space available for the installation of the equipment was insufficient. Therefore, a new installation location for the AHUs had to be found on the roof. The large 80,000 m\u00b3/h units were placed on a steel platform on the connection between two buildings. In addition to saving energy, the criteria unit size, weight saving and noise reduction were therefore also key requirements.\n\n## A NEW AIR CONDITIONING GENERATION\n\nThe high demands could only be met with the new generation of air handling units, in which the highly efficient axial fans from NOVENCO were optimally utilized. The last equipment was put into operation in mid-December and exceeded all expectations.\n\nThe ZerAx\u00ae axial fans currently represent the world's leading fan technology with fan efficiencies of up to 92%. NOVENCO, however, went one step further by optimizing the ZerAx\u00ae even more for use in the air handling units.\n\n## NEW GENERATION OF AIR CONDITIONING\n\n- ALL DEVICES WITH TWO PARALLEL SUPPLY AND EXHAUST FANS\n- NEWLY DEVELOPED DIFFUSERS 1.5 x D, OPTIMIZED FOR FREE OUTLET\n- NEW EC MOTORS UP TO 31 KW AND DANFOSS EC+ CONCEPT\n- NEW AHU TECHNOLOGY LEADS TO 20% ENERGY SAVINGS, IS 30% SHORTER AND 30% LIGHTER\n\n## INTERACTION OF DIFFERENT COMPONENTS\n\nThe key phrase here is intelligent interaction of the system components. At NOVENCO this interaction is embodied in the term EC+ and is developed in cooperation with Danfoss, Denmark. Only the optimal interaction of the system components fan - motor - electronics \u2013 diffusor, makes the full potential of a highly efficient fan realizable.\n\n## SYSTEM EFFICIENCY INCREASE:\n\n- AXIAL FANS WITH UP TO 92% EFFICIENCY\n- NEWLY DEVELOPED EC MOTORS WITH UP TO 31 KW POWER AND EFFICIENCIES OF UP TO 96%\n- OPTIMIZED FREQUENCY INVERTERS FOR EC MOTORS WITH UP TO 98% EFFICIENCY\n- NEWLY DEVELOPED DIFFUSERS, OPTIMIZED FOR FREE OUTLET\n\n## [View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/2110/vw-navarra-mu-15863-0319-gb.pdf)"

Within this, the expenses for ventilation are by far the largest expenditure item in the energy field.\n\nThis has led to the completion of the first stage of replacing the old fans. So far 35 fans have been replaced. These new fans still work in conjunction with the older [ventilation systems](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/smoke-control/) that were installed in the 1950s and 1960s \u2013 yet the savings have been significant and immediate.\n\n\"In our experience the ROI is shorter the bigger the fan is, and we have seen that the ROI is down to less than one year for our ZerAx fans,\" says J\u00f8rgen S\u00f8feldt, who is the functional manager of plumbing and HVAC at the Odense University Hospital.\n\n## EFFICIENCY RATES OF ABOUT 90%\n\nThe old fans have had efficiency rates of as little as about 40%, while the new fans offer around 90%. They are also so silent that it has been possible to remove the noise locks on the ventilation system, which has reduced the resistance further.\n\n\"On paper there are fans that are cheaper to purchase than Novenco's. But if one calculates the total consumption for the entire period, during which we expect to use them, it looks completely different. We have said that we want the product that offers the best efficiency rate. This means, that apart from the energy saving, we also want to be able to incorporate the fans in our existing ventilation system without problems, and service and production guarantees are also important,\" says J\u00f8rgen S\u00f8feldt.\n\n## CONTINUOUSLY INCREASING DEMAND\n\nThe ventilation system of the old university hospital was an on-demand system. For example a surgical department used far less ventilation than offices and the demand was very different for summer and winter. Generally, the demand was continuously increasing because the capacity of the hospital has been continuously increased over the years. This has put the 60 year old ventilation system under huge pressure, but the pressure and the risk of breakdowns has been reduced significantly with the far more energy-efficient fans.\n\n## SAVINGS WITH SHORT ROI\n\nLike many others, the Odense University Hospital makes use of the possibility of converting the CO2 reduction into money through the energy companies. Instead of receiving cash money the company has, however, decided to spend the money for energy consultants, who give advice on how to obtain further savings on the budget.\n\nThere are several indications that further replacement of fans will be prioritised due to the short ROI. \"Knowing that we are moving to a new university hospital in 2018 we are wary of making investments that are too longterm and have too long ROI,\" says J\u00f8rgen S\u00f8feldt.\n\n## FACTS\n\n- 34% REDUCTION OF THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION\n- 402 TONS REDUCED CO2 EMISSION PER YEAR\n- ROI OF DOWN TO 1 YEAR\n\n## [View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1178/odense-universitethospital-mu-15493-0317-gb.pdf)"

Continuous manual fan operation drives unnecessary power consumption while failing to optimize air quality based on actual CO concentrations.\n\nIn 2001, NOVENCO Building & Industry installed one of the first jet fans systems in the United Kingdom for an enclosed underground car park of a shopping mall in South East England. This car park facility with 1,350 parking spaces operates continuously 24/7. Without intelligent CO detection system integration, manual fan operation resulted in excessive energy consumption over 20 years of operation.\n\n## Automated CO monitoring replaces manual controls\n\nThe recommended solution delivered:\n- **Automated CO monitoring system** replacing manual fan controls\n- **Zone-specific activation** targeting only areas requiring ventilation\n- **Real-time response** to actual pollution levels rather than time-based operation\n- **Energy optimization** through intelligent operation protocols\n\nThe autonomous CO detection system continuously monitors CO concentrations using strategically positioned sensors throughout the facility. When threshold values are exceeded, the system activates jet fans only in affected zones, eliminating unnecessary operation in unoccupied areas while maintaining safety standards.\n\n## Royal HaskoningDHV validates performance and compliance\n\nIndependent consulting firm Royal HaskoningDHV conducted comprehensive CO measurements before implementation and confirmed maintained air quality standards while achieving substantial operational improvements.\n\nThe rigorous validation process included:\n- **Pre-installation baseline** measurements documenting existing performance\n- **Post-upgrade verification** confirming air quality maintenance\n- **Energy consumption analysis** quantifying operational improvements\n- **Compliance confirmation** meeting all safety and regulatory standards\n\nThe validation demonstrated that the intelligent control system maintains equivalent CO levels compared to continuous operation, while activating fans only when CO concentrations require dilution. This targeted approach delivered measured 85.5% energy saving verified by independent testing.\n\n## Zone-specific activation optimises fan operation\n\nThe car park ventilation control system monitors CO levels continuously and responds with zone-specific activation, ensuring optimal air quality.\n\nUpon detecting elevated CO concentration, the system activates jet fans in affected areas while increasing extract capacity in nearest shafts. This coordinated response ensures rapid pollutant removal without unnecessary energy expenditure.\n\nSystem operation features include:\n- **Continuous monitoring** of CO concentrations throughout the facility\n- **Zone-specific activation** targeting only areas requiring ventilation\n- **Variable speed control** optimizing fan operation based on pollution levels\n- **Coordinated extract system** enhancing pollutant removal efficiency\n\nThe jet fans induce surrounding air to ensure optimal mixing of contaminated air with fresh air within targeted zones. Variable speed-controlled exhaust fans remove harmful gases efficiently while adapting to actual ventilation requirements. NOVENCO control panels maintain CO concentrations at safe levels while minimizing power consumption through intelligent operation protocols.\n\n### [View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5867/control-system-upgrade-gb-15953-0521.pdf)\n",

At that time, the system was designed without a CO detection system.\nThe car park with 1,350 parking spaces is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Even after 20 years of constant operation, the NOVENCO fans still run perfectly. In the absence of a CO monitoring system, many fans are switched on manually and run 24/7, leading to unnecessary energy consumption. This is far from an optimal solution in today's energy-saving world.\nTo improve the efficiency of the system as a whole, the recommended solution was to refurbish the car park with new control panels and a fully automatic CO monitoring system to reduce electricity consumption.\n\n### FAST AND EASY UPGRADE RESULTS IN INCREDIBLE ENERGY REDUCTION\n\nBased on the simplicity and robustness of the proposed system, NOVENCO was rewarded the contract again, but this time as the supplier of the control system with an autonomous CO monitoring system.\nThe CO detection system continuously monitors CO concentrations throughout the car park using strategically positioned sensors. If a threshold value is exceeded, the system triggers a signal to the control panels, which activate the jet fan system only for the area where the increased concentration was measured.\nPrior to replacing the control panels, the main contractor entrusted an independent consulting company, Royal HaskoningDHV, with carrying out measurements of the CO levels in the car park. CO measurements were also taken after the upgrade, which were similar to those before the upgrade. The significant difference with the new CO detection system was that the fans were only switched on when CO concentrations were elevated, whereas they used to be in operation 24/7. Although a reduction in energy consumption was expected, the measurement results showed a staggering 85.5% energy saving.\n\n### INCREDIBLE ENERGY REDUCTION\n\nThe NOVENCO [car park ventilation](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/car-parks/) control system is highly intelligent and monitors the CO levels constantly. Upon detection of an increased CO concentration, the intelligent control system only activates jet fans in the affected area and slightly increases the extract capacity in the nearest extract shaft to draw in fresh air and dilute harmful gases.\nThe car park jet fans induce the surrounding air, making sure that the contaminated air is perfectly mixed with the fresh air within the affected zone. Variable speed-controlled extract fans remove the unhealthy gases in\nthe affected zones. The newly installed control panels for this car park ventilation system are dedicated to keeping CO concentrations at very safe levels while minimising power consumption.\n\n### [View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/5867/control-system-upgrade-gb-15953-0521.pdf)"

The company pioneered the manufacturing of radial tires and offers a wide range of tyres for different types of vehicles. The high cost of energy and the increasing level of environmental awareness, spurred JK Tyres to search for modern and more efficient solutions in the field of energy saving for their tyre manufacturing plant in Chennai.\n\nAfter a large and exhaustive research of all available solutions on the market, including EC fans, JK Tyres in close cooperation with Xero Energy Engineering Solutions Pvt Ltd, chose the market's most efficient and innovative solution known as the EC+ concept. The concept is precisely conceived to increase the efficiency of HVAC systems and comprises high efficiency ZerAx\u00ae fans, high efficiency motors and the intelligent and high efficiency Danfoss VFDs. The combined system has the potential to deliver efficiencies up to an impressive 85%, which is the highest possible total system efficiency for AHUs available on the market. Not only the numbers, but also the most modern technology of the EC+ concept, convinced JK Tyres to retrofit an old centrifugal fan in an existing air handling unit with a high efficient ZerAx\u00ae axial flow fan, high efficiency motor and Danfoss variable speed drives.\n\n## PIONEERING PROJECT\n\nThis project marks the first successful installation of the EC+ concept in India and makes JK Tyres pioneers of the concept in the Asian region. With an original expectation of 30% energy savings and an achieved implementation of more than 50%, this project is pure proof of concept of the magnitude of energy savings that is achievable by retrofitting centrifugal fans with ZerAx\u00ae [axial flow fans](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/) based on the EC+ concept.\n\n## HIGH-TECH INSTALLATION\n\nAs the first manufacturer in India JK Tyres trusts in the EC+ concept and has retrofitted an existing air handling unit with a high efficiency ZerAx\u00ae axial flow fan AZN 900/350\u20106 in the tyre manufacturing plant in Chennai. The installed system consists of the highly efficient ZerAx\u00ae fan, high efficiency motor and the intelligent and high efficiency Danfoss VFD. The ZerAx\u00ae fan now saves considerable amounts of energy and supplies fresh air to a critical part of the production, where treads are put onto tires to provide grip on the road. This is also the hottest part in the tyre plant with temperatures reaching up to 46 \u00b0C when summer peaks and operates almost continuously.\n\n## ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS\n\nNot only have JK Tyres reduced their energy consumption, but by using NOVENCO EC+ technology, they have also significantly reduced their carbon dioxide emissions, which complements other corporate social responsibility initiatives currently on-going at the Chennai plant.\n\n*\"AHUs in a very significant way contribute towards the present fixed power consumption of the Chennai Plant. We have taken a trial with replacing the conventional centrifugal fan with ZerAx axial flow fan and the savings in power consumption is immense for the same comfort levels of the operative team. Based on the actual savings recorded, it is decided to take up the project of 100% replacement existing AHU fans with the ZerAx axial fans. This project is under implementation .\"* says Unni Nayar, Vice President JK Tyres India.\n\n## [View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1981/jk-tyres-mu-15711-0918-gb.pdf)"

With ventilation representing 23% of total energy consumption at their Fredericia brewery, systematic fan replacement became a priority specification project.\n\nThe upgrade addressed aging 1970s equipment operating at constant full capacity in humid bottling halls. ZerAx\u00ae fans provide technical solutions for exhausting moist air while injecting dry, warm air with measurable efficiency improvements.\n\nFinancial analysis shows CO2 reduction benefits contributing 0.04 GBP per saved kWh through carbon credits, supporting the business case for equipment replacement.\n\n## Independent verification confirms 438,872 kWh/year savings\n\nEnergy consultant Bjarne Pedersen confirmed achievement of specified performance targets before final ventilation system adjustments. \"The fans deliver the projected 30% cost reduction. Additional savings result from improved control system integration. Measurement verification using tong test ammeters confirms expected performance specifications.\"\n\nThe ZerAx\u00ae calculation methodology incorporates frequency control capabilities, enabling total system savings exceeding individual fan specifications. Documented energy consumption analysis provides verified data:\n\n- Baseline electricity consumption (legacy system): 890,400 kWh/year\n- Calculated consumption (ZerAx\u00ae fans in existing system): 451,528 kWh/year\n- Documented annual savings from fan specification: 438,872 kWh/year\n- Independent energy savings certification issued by contracted ventilation firm\n\n## 2.2 year payback meets investment criteria\n\nFinancial analysis demonstrates 2.2 years ROI for complete system replacement including consultancy and installation. This represents one system among approximately 20 total ventilation systems requiring specification and replacement.\n\nThe systematic replacement programme involves double-digit million investment requirements, executed in phases across the facility. Investment criteria mandate two-year payback periods for all equipment specifications.\n\nCurrent year savings projections for the initial system approach GBP 49,000, validating the engineering economics model for subsequent phases.\n\n## Superior acoustic performance in bottling halls\n\nBeyond energy specifications, our fans deliver superior acoustic performance in high-noise industrial environments.

The ventilation constitutes 23% of the total energy consumption at the brewery in Fredericia, and the CO2 reduction contributes with 0.04 GBP per saved kWh in sales of CO2.\n\nTherefore, it was primarily for financial reasons that it was decided to replace the old fans installed in the 1970's with new ZerAx\u00ae fans. When the first fans were installed, they were not adjusted and therefore ran at constant full capacity in very humid surroundings, in one of the bottling halls that works 24/7. The purpose was to exhaust the moist air and inject dry, warm air.\n\n### THE PROMISED SAVINGS ACHIEVED\n\nAccording to Carlsberg's energy consultant Bjarne Pedersen the promised savings have already been achieved, before the adjustment of the ventilation. \"We expect the fans to lead to cost reduction of 30%. The rest will be obtained through a change in the control of our ventilation system. We still need to make the final calculations, but a measurement with a tong test ammeter shows that we are close to attaining the expected savings,\" says Bjarne Pedersen.\n\nThe ZerAx\u00ae fan calculation is based on frequency control and therefore the obtained total savings will be higher than the savings calculated for the fan. The replacement of Carlsberg's fans presupposes the following budget data.\n\n- Prior electricity consumption (the old ventilation system): 890,400 kWh/year\nTheoretical electricity consumption (new fans in the old system): 451,528 kWh/year\nSaving partly due to the new fans: 438,872 kWh/year\n- Carlsberg employed a ventilation company to solve the task of replacing the fans and this company has issued an energy savings certificate.\n\n### ROI OF 2 YEARS\n\nThe calculations show that the ROI of the task comprising the consultancy work and the replacement of the entire system including fans is 2.2 years. The [ventilation system](https://www.novenco-building.com/solutions/smoke-control/) that has been replaced so far is just one out of approx. 20 ventilation systems. In total, the replacements will reach an amount in the double-digit million range. The replacements started in one end of the brewery and will be made in stages.\n\nThe prerequisite is that the investment on the entire replacement should be recovered within two years, and already now it seems that the savings on just the one ventilation system that has been installed this year will be around GBP 49,000.\n\nHowever, the work environment is also important to Carlsberg. \"In the bottling halls the noise level is so high that it is absolutely impossible to hear the fans, but it is still evident that these fans move more air than they make noise,\" says Bjarne Pedersen.\n\n### [View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1174/carlsberg-mu-15674-0218-gb.pdf)"

The principle is used in hydro-electric power stations all over the world. The cost of hydroelectricity is relatively low, making it a competitive source of renewable energy. Interestingly, a hydro station consumes no water, unlike coal or gas plants. The second largest hydro-electric power station in Norway, the Sima Power Station is located in Eidfjord in Hordaland and is surrounded by fjords, which are so characteristic of the Norwegian landscape. The main hall of the power station is placed 700 metres inside a mountain. It measures an impressive 200 m in length, is 20 m wide and 40 m high. The Sima Power Station draws water from several river basins, which enables the water to be stored in reservoirs. The water is released when extra supplies of electricity are needed.\n\nThe Sima Power Station operates at an installed total capacity of 1,120 MW and has an average total annual production of 2,850 GWh.\n\n## THE SOLUTION\n\nNOVENCO Building & Industry (NBI) has delivered and installed 9 high efficiency ZerAx\u00ae fans as part of a comprehensive energy-retrofit of the power station. The fans ventilate all tunnels and working areas inside the mountain, and help remove the heat generated by the power house with transformer and within the generator areas. The replacement of the old fans with the ZerAx\u00ae fans resulted in at least 30% reduction in energy consumption.\n\nWith retrofit solutions NBI offers to reduce energy consumption in existing installations by replacing old fans with much more efficient and energy saving fans. Furthermore, and perhaps more importantly, environmental impact and CO2 emissions are significantly reduced. The climate and energy consumption can often be improved considerably, when ventilation systems are retrofitted with our innovative solutions.\n\n## EQUIPMENT DELIVERY\n\nFresh air is supplied to the tunnels and working areas with support of 2 pcs ZerAx\u00ae AZN 1600 and 2 pcs ZerAx\u00ae AZN 1000 [axial flow fans](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/) with a total airflow capacity of approx. 395,000 m\u00b3/h. Further, 3 pcs ZerAx\u00ae AZN 1600, 1 pc ZerAx\u00ae AZN 1120 and 1 pc ZerAx\u00ae AZN 1000 axial flow fans with a total exhaust capacity of approx. 500,000 m\u00b3/h, ensure that the heat generated by the power house and generator areas is extracted.\n\nAll the ZerAx\u00ae fans were delivered with inlet cones and diffusers to get the best uniform airflow. The inlet cones and diffusers were delivered separately and in parts due to the limited space in the tunnels of the power station.\n\n## [View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1159/sima-power-station-mu-15480-0517-gb.pdf)"

The Group's portfolio is extensive and diverse with presence in Mouth Freshener, Food and Beverage, Confectionery, Hospitality, Agri, Luxury Retail, Tobacco businesses and also other investments.\n\nThe company is committed to create premium quality products and has built successful brands across many categories.\nThe DS Group Headquarters (DSHQ), situated at NCR houses the Corporate office, an R&D centre and state of art manufacturing facilities. It has been awarded Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum certification, under the US Green Building Council (USGBC) existing building; Operation and Maintenance (O&M) programme version 4.0 for being a green building.\nDSHQ is the leader amongst all LEED v4 O&M existing buildings worldwide for two consecutive years and still holds the highest number of credits amongst existing green building projects clearly making it a global leader.\n\n### RETROFIT TO THE LATEST AHU TECHNOLOGY\n\nThe DS Group has recently performed a large retrofit project of the air handling units (AHUs) at the headquarters in Noida. The retrofit comprised replacement of 40 out-dated centrifugal fans with highly efficient, state-of-the-art NOVENCO\u00ae ZerAx\u00ae fans.\nThe retrofit project is part of the company's Sustainable Development journey, which aligns their business, social and environmental objectives to make significant contribution to the society at large.\nThe initial phase of the project included Proof of Concept (PoC) - in the form of replacing a single existing centrifugal fan with a ZerAx fan. The purpose of this pilot project was to test the ZerAx and to witness the energy savings first hand, when replacing an old centrifugal fan with a modern and advanced ZerAx axial fan.\nPrior to the retrofit, the performance of one of the existing AHUs with centrifugal fan installed was measured by by our Authorised Channel Partner **AIR TECHNO INDIA PVT. LTD.** to establish the baseline.\nThe same measurements were then made post-retrofit. The results showed that for the same air flow rate the ZerAx fan had reduced the energy consumption by 55%. Once again, the ZerAx fans proved to be on the technological forefront with the highest efficiency as well as invaluable contribution to certification programmes of sustainable buildings.\n\n### A GREEN WIN-WIN SOLUTION\n\nAs sustainability is at the core of the DS Group's mission and it's commitment on strategic integration of sustainability into the organizational Systems and Processes. This large retrofit project not only saves a significant amount of electrical power and reduces carbon emissions, it also demonstrates the company's commitment to the green transition.\nThis, together with the fact that the NOVENCO ZerAx fan is 98% recyclable after a product lifetime of 20+ years, means that the AHUs installed at the DS Groups' headquarters are now truly environmental friendly. A pure and green win-win solution, for the DS Group and the environment.\n\n![Ramesh Kumar](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/6132/ramesh-kumar.jpg?width=250&height=210&mode=max)\n\n*\"The DS Group Headquarters (DSHQ), a LEED Platinum certified green building is the leader amongst all LEED v4 O&M existing Buildings worldwide for two consecutive years and still holds the highest number of credits\namongst existing green building projects across the Globe.*\n\n*We have a goal to become Zero Carbon facility by the end of 2023.*\n\n*In our quest for the same, we come across ZerAx axial fans technology, which has certain benefits over the conventional centrifugal blowers such as high energy savings, lesser ROI period, improved system efficiency etc.\nThis product also contributes in reducing carbon emission and is certified by the The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) as a green product.*\n\n*We conducted a sample retrofit pilot project at our premises to understand the projected energy savings\nand the results were encouraging.\nWe are delighted to share that we managed to reduce substantial energy consumption, to the tune of > 55% in our AHU systems after 1st phase of implementation.*\n\n*We are satisfied with the outcome and would like to implement the 2nd phase in our other offices.\",* says Mr. Ramesh Kumar,\nSenior General Manager, Head for Administration and Facilities, DS Group\n\n![Vikash Mishra](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/6131/vikash-mishra.jpg?width=250&height=204&mode=max)\n\n**Mr. Vikash Mishra**, Deputy General Manager, Technical Facility Management, DS Group says: *\"We found the installation team of Air techno India Pvt Ltd highly professional and they carried the installation as per the guidelines and mutually agreed schedule.*\n\n*As this was a retrofit technology, installation was done during no-operational hours for smooth execution.

The redeveloped former Southampton Hotel in St. Helier was unveiled to near-universal praise after it had spent months under the cover of scaffolding and hoardings at the Weighbridge Place. Now named Weighbridge House, the completely renovated building contains 17,000 sq ft of space with ground floor and basement area designed as bar and restaurant, and four floors of modern commercial offices above.\n\nThe renovation of the Southampton Hotel restored its former glory. Islanders welcomed the return of the property, which is a familiar sight in photos of Liberation Day, where it forms part of the backdrop to one of the Island's most memorable moments.\n\n### TOP CLASS SOLUTION\n\nNOVENCO Building & Industry designed and provided its unique stairwell pressurisation system, nowadays an unusual system for the United Kingdom. This system creates a positive pressure within the escape stairs in the building and conforms with BS-EN-12101-6. The purpose of this system is to create an airflow over the open doors preventing smoke from entering the stairs.\n\n### EQUIPMENT DELIVERY\n\nNOVENCO Building & Industry worked closely with the project team to design the pressurisation system in line with the EN12101-6 as a Class C system. The maximum flow rate of the system was calculated on the basis of maintaining 10 Pa pressure within the stairwell when a single leaf door is in the fully open position.\n\nA fan set with NovAx [axial flow fans](https://www.novenco-building.com/products/axial-flow-fans/) type ACN 710/330-10, with diverse air inlet routes was placed on the roof. A separate air release shaft with dampers was installed within the lobbies to provide an air release route to the roof and a Novenco TMS-unit for termination of the shaft.\n\nDue to the height of the building a part of the make up air is provided at a high level in the stairwell, and another part further down the stairs through a supply shaft with a supply grill.\n\nThe system was succesfully commissioned and handed over by NOVENCO Building & Industry, who also is engaged to complete the annual maintenance visits.\n\n### [View the PDF Version with additional information and pictures](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/1163/weighbridge-house-mu15490-0317-gb.pdf)"

This opened up new possibilities for safer, greener and more economical solutions. But even so, the certified smoke fan and VSD packages are still to be discovered by many.*\n\nThe 2015 update to the EN 12101-3 standard for powered smoke and heat control fans enabled safer, more energy-efficient solutions for high-rise buildings, car parks and tunnels. The standard provides three options:\n\n1. Run the smoke fan at nominal motor speed without VSD. You can use a VSD, but it must be bypassed during fire events. This limits flexibility for smoke operation and requires additional control equipment within the control panel.\n\n2. Use a smoke fan with uncertified VSD package. This requires 20% motor power de-rating, an additional waveform filter, and oversized VSD, emergency power supply and cabling to accommodate the power reserve.\n\n3. Use a certified smoke fan with VSD package, where the complete system is tested and certified for smoke and heat control. This delivers maximum reliability, reduced operating costs and flexible smoke control.\n\nAs buildings rise higher, reliable smoke ventilation systems become increasingly critical. Ventilation systems must create safe escape routes, assist fire brigades and protect property.\n\n![Smoke control fan testing at high temperature with variable speed drives](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/maqlfct3/novenco-zerax-smoke-fan-plus-vsd-high-temp-test.jpg?rmode=max&width=500)\n*Smoke control fan testing at MPA Braunschweig with VSD*\n\n## Dual-purpose systems enhance operational flexibility\n\nFrequency converters enable operation at all flow rates, creating dual-purpose fans for normal ventilation and smoke extraction during fires. Certified smoke fan and VSD packages ensure compliance with current regulations.\n\nJos Wissink, Business Development Manager at NOVENCO Building & Industry, says: *\"As high-efficiency fans with VSD are now available as a certified package for smoke extraction, facility managers have the possibility for a more profitable set-up: maximum energy savings and state-of-the-art smoke ventilation system all in one solution\"*.\n\n## Reduced power consumption enables smaller infrastructure\n\nReduced power consumption with high-efficiency smoke fans enables smaller power supply systems, cables and emergency power infrastructure. While certified packages may have higher installation costs, total lifetime investment and running costs are significantly reduced.\n\nComparing the NOVENCO NovAx\u2122 range of axial smoke fans with the high-efficiency ZerAx\u00ae smoke fans, the NovAx\u2122 ACN 1250 F300 requires 65kW versus 56kW for the ZerAx\u00ae AZN 1250. This 14% power reduction lowers running costs and enables 14% smaller power supply equipment and UPS systems. Combined with lower sound levels, the ZerAx\u00ae provides clear advantages.\n\n## High efficiency reduces emissions and costs\n\nEfficiency levels directly impact operating costs, CO\u2082 emissions and environmental performance. NOVENCO's ZerAx\u00ae axial flow fan achieves efficiency levels up to 92% and 98% recyclability after 20 years in operation, documented by Stena Recycling.\n\nOptimal aerodynamic design delivers extremely low sound levels, reducing or eliminating silencing requirements. This lowers system resistance, power consumption, installation costs and running costs.\n\n## Certified systems guarantee emergency performance\n\nWhile cost reductions provide clear benefits, reliability remains paramount. ZerAx\u00ae smoke fans with Danfoss VLT\u00ae frequency converters operate as certified emergency systems tested for hot smoke temperatures.\n\nThis certified package creates safe escape routes, assists fire brigades and protects property. When fire safety is priority, certified solutions guarantee reliable performance during long-duration smoke and heat exhaust situations.\n\n*NOVENCO designs, develops and manufactures ventilation products and systems used in a range of applications all around the world.

This opened up new possibilities for safer, greener and more economical solutions. But even so, the certified smoke fan and VSD packages are still to be discovered by many.*\n\nIncreasing the safety of a high-rise building, a car park or tunnel and at the same time reducing the running costs with more energy-efficient operation would be an exciting route to explore for many. With the changes in 2015 to the EN 12101-3 standard for powered smoke and heat control fans, this became a scenario within reach. The standard lays out three options:\n\n1. Run the smoke fan at nominal motor speed without VSD. For this, you only need a certified smoke fan. You can use a VSD, but this VSD must be bypassed in case of a fire. This means you can only run the smoke exhaust at the nominal motor speed, which limits the flexibility for smoke operation significantly. Furthermore, the bypass option requires additional (costly) control equipment within the control panel.\n\n2. Use a smoke fan with VSD, which have not been tested and certified as a package. With this set-up, you have to de-rate the motor power by 20%. Furthermore, you need an additional waveform filter between the frequency converter and the motor, which adds considerably to the costs. The costs will further increase since the VSD, emergency power supply and cabling also have to be designed for the 20% extra power reserve.\n\n3. Use a certified smoke fan with VSD package, where the complete package is tested and certified for smoke and heat control systems. This solution enables you to use the full potential of the complete package.\n\nThe last option, a certified package with a smoke fan and frequency converter, allows the facility managers to use variable speed-controlled fans in the event of fires. The outcome? Maximum reliability in combination with reduced operating costs and flexibility to control the smoke control and extraction.\n\nIn a real estate market with a tendency to build higher and higher, the requirements for reliable smoke ventilation systems becomes equally higher. The need for ventilation systems that create safe escape routes, assist the fire brigade in smoke extraction and protect the building are a critical factor.\n\n![Smoke control fan testing at high temperature with variable speed drives](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/maqlfct3/novenco-zerax-smoke-fan-plus-vsd-high-temp-test.jpg?rmode=max&width=500)\n_Smoke control fan testing at MPA Braunschweig with VSD_\n\n## From wasting to saving energy\n\nUsing frequency converters allows you to operate the fan at all possible flow rates. In effect, the fans become dual-purpose fans with a VSD. They can be used for normal ventilation purposes, and they can operate as smoke extraction fans in case of fires. In the EU, the above options 1 and 2 apply to smoke fans, which are not certified together with a VSD. But when you choose a certified smoke fan and frequency drive package, you know that it complies with the rules in force.\n\nJos Wissink, Business Development Manager at NOVENCO Building & Industry, says: _\"As high-efficiency fans with VSD are now available as a certified package for smoke extraction, facility managers have the possibility for a more profitable set-up: maximum energy savings and state-of-the-art smoke ventilation system all in one solution\"_.\n\n## Going green: additional cost-saving benefits\n\nSince the power consumption is reduced with high-efficiency smoke fans, the necessary power supply and related costs to the power supply systems can be scaled down. In addition to the energy savings, you can reach further initial cost savings through smaller power cables and a reduction of the normal and emergency power supply system costs.\n\nEven though the installation costs of a certified package with a smoke fan and frequency converter may be higher than other alternatives, the initial total investment costs and running costs are reduced to a degree that makes the investment highly attractive. The key is to look at the total lifetime costs \u2013 and not just one element in the package.\n\nFor example, a comparison of the same system shows the differences between industry standard solutions such as the NOVENCO NovAx\u2122 range of axial smoke fans and the high-efficiency range of ZerAx\u00ae smoke fans. With all selection variables set to the same setting, the electrical power input requirement for the NovAx\u2122 ACN 1250 F300 is 65kW versus 56kW for the ZerAx\u00ae AZN 1250. The difference in power consumption is almost 14% which will lead to considerably lower running costs. Furthermore, power supply equipment, including UPS systems, can be dimensioned 14% smaller, resulting in lower initial investment costs. And with a considerably lower sound level, the ZerAx\u00ae is the obvious choice.\n\n## High efficiency and low sound levels\n\nOne of the most interesting features when choosing a certified fan and VSD package is the efficiency level. It impacts the operating costs, reduces CO\u2082 emissions and benefits the environment. NOVENCO's ZerAx\u00ae axial flow fan reaches efficiency levels up to 92% and an impressive 98% recyclability rate after more than 20 years in operation as documented in a Recyclability Analysis by Stena Recycling. This makes it the most efficient and probably also the most sustainable dual-purpose fan on the market today.\n\nAt the same time, as a result of the optimal aerodynamic design, the fan has extremely low sound levels. For normal ventilation modes, you require less silencing, and the attenuators can be smaller \u2013 or even omitted. This results in lower system resistance and, therefore, even less power is needed. Essentially, both installation costs and running costs are affected positively.\n\n## When safety is the first priority\n\nSome might say that the cost reductions are an added bonus. The main advantage is that you can count on the highly reliable ZerAx\u00ae smoke fans with Danfoss VLT\u00ae frequency converters to do the job, they are designed to do: operate as a certified emergency system that never fails.\n\nIf your emergency system fails, human lives are at risk and knowing that the smoke fan is tested and certified for operation at hot smoke temperatures gives peace of mind. With the ZerAx\u00ae and Danfoss VLT\u00ae package, you create safe escape routes for the occupants, assist the fire brigade in firefighting and protect the property. Reliability is at the core and choosing a certified solution guarantees that the fans can endure long-duration smoke and heat exhaust situations.\n\nWhen safety is your first priority, a certified smoke fan and VSD package is the natural choice simply because it is reliable in every aspect.\n\n---\n\n_NOVENCO designs, develops and manufactures ventilation products and systems used in a range of applications all around the world.

Wasteful manufacturing energy contributes directly to greenhouse gas emissions when materials reach landfill rather than being recycled.\n\nSustainable green fans address the take-make-waste approach through:\n\n- **Third-party verified recyclability** - Independent analysis confirms performance\n- **Extended product lifetimes** - Robust engineering reduces replacement needs\n- **Climate-friendly manufacturing** - Optimised processes minimise environmental impact\n- **Material utilisation optimisation** - Precision specifications reduce waste\n\n## Third-party verified sustainable fan performance\n\nThe NOVENCO\u00ae ZerAx\u00ae fan demonstrates systematic application of design for recycling principles.\n\nIndependent recyclability analysis by Stena Recycling A/S in 2020 verified ZerAx fans achieve a 98% recyclability rating. Virtually all materials can be recycled according to established waste management protocols.\n\nManufacturing optimisation delivers:\n\n- **Documented production processes** - Specifications ensure greener manufacturing\n- **Precision engineering** - Minimised material waste through controlled design\n- **Enhanced waste protocols** - Improved sorting and recovery systems\n- **Supply chain specifications** - Environmental requirements for partners\n- **Pollution reduction** - Controlled manufacturing processes\n\n## Technical documentation and compliance\n\nThird-party verification and systematic environmental engineering support this position as a leading supplier of sustainable fans.

As a manufacturing company, we know that we must optimise the use of materials and contribute to the reduction of wasteful practices, and we take our responsibility very seriously.\n\n### Putting an end to wasteful practices\n\nWe have analysed our production processes and applied design for recycling principles in line with our commitment to the SDGs. We applied the recycling design principles because the energy used to manufacture components go to waste when materials are sent to landfill rather than recycled, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Being that we are environmentally ambitous, we wanted to do better.\n\nSome of the aspects that make our products a green answer to the take-make-waste approach are:\n\n- high recyclability ratings\n- long product lifetimes\n- climate-friendly manufacturing\n- optimised use of materials\n\n### A green fan with 98% recyclability rate\n\nThe NOVENCO\u00ae ZerAx\u00ae fan is a perfect example of how we apply design for recycling into the manufacturing of products.\n\nA recyclability analysis by Stena Recycling A/S in 2020 showed that the ZerAx fans had a 98% recyclability rating, which means that close to all the materials in these fans can be recycled.\n\nBy rethinking our development and manufacturing patterns, we were able to:\n\n- make our production processes greener\n- minimise scrap\n- improve waste sorting\n- define environmental specifications for suppliers and partners\n- minimise pollution\n\n<!-- Video: https://www.youtube.com/embed/D309FJKFj-g -->\n\n### Curbing climate change\n\nThe steps we have taken underpin our position as the leading green fan supplier, but we do more and continue to fight the climate changes to reduce gas emissions and protect and preserve our natural resources, as our products and solutions are designed for a sustainable future.\n\n## Downloads\n\n### Case\n\n- [Better results through increased upcycling of materials](https://www.novenco-building.com/media/4330/stena-recycling-and-novenco-building-industry-case-gb.pdf)"
